Player 1, pretending to be the Seer, claimed Player 2 has a good identity and absurdly stated that their verification carried great weight. This statement is ridiculous and laughable! Player 2 claims to be the Guard. I think Player 2 is either the real Guard or Player 1's werewolf teammate, using the Guard role to gather votes for Player 1. So I believe Player 2 is either the Guard or a werewolf. Player 3 clearly also spotted Player 1's mistakes during their speech and made a well-reasoned argument. I think Player 3 is on the good side.
