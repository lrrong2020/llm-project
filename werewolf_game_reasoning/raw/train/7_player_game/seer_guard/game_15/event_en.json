Player 6 only said that Player 1 might be the Seer or a villager, but Player 7 twisted it into \"Player 6 thinks there are two Seers.\" Therefore, I will verify Player 7 tonight. Player 5, as the Guard, please make sure to protect me! As for Player 2's attempt to pretend to be the Seer, it's laughable.

Player 3's speech was very artificial, saying \"Player 2 pretends to be a seer and gives me a good identity, I must be grateful and immediately side with 2,\" and even said \"I will serve 2 wholeheartedly and stand by player 2 until death.\" This speech is glib and insincere, showing no concern for the situation on the field. I believe player 3 is likely a werewolf rushing to support their werewolf teammate, player 2. Since player 3 is a werewolf, player 2, who gave 3 a good identity, must be pretending to be a seer.\n\n- **Player 4**: Gave player 5 a good identity. Player 4's speech carefully analyzed the field situation, commenting on each player in the front positions. At least in terms of speech attitude, 4 is much more sincere than 2. I believe player 4 has the perspective of a seer and is likely the real seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 4 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgment on this.\n\n# Identity Assessment of Other Players Based on the Seer:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 4.\n- **Player 3**: Blindly sided with player 2 when only 2 claimed to be the seer.

If Player 4 were a werewolf, pretending to be a seer in the last position wouldn't be very beneficial, as they could easily be voted out by the good team.
