This verification has considerable weight, as werewolves rarely risk giving a good identity to a later player, potentially identifying the real seer as \"counter-verification\". Player 3's verification carries significant weight, likely making them the true seer.\n\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 1 as good identity. Since player 1 is already out and cannot speak, player 7's declaration of player 1 as good identity carries no risk of counter-verification. Therefore, player 7's verification lacks any weight.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity assessments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 7**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 3.\n- **Player 4**: Player 3's good identity, definitely a good role.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 7 > 3 > 4\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 7.",

Player 3 dared to directly declare player 4 as a good identity when only four players were left to speak in the later positions, not afraid of declaring a fellow seer as good and causing a \"counter-declaration\". Therefore, I believe player 3's verification has strong credibility. Player 3's speech was relaxed and confident, displaying the mindset of a seer.\n- **Player 7**: Declared player 1 as a good identity. Player 7 directly identified player 4 as a werewolf, which doesn't align with my judgment. Moreover, player 7's declaration of player 1 as good is not as convincing as player 3's. I believe player 7 is more likely to be pretending to be a seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the real seer.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 7 > 3\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 7.",

Player 3, speaking early, indeed can't analyze much logic, but has a proper attitude, resembling a seer's state.\n\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 1 as good identity, believes players 3 and 4 are werewolves, wants to lynch player 3. I think player 2 is likely a low-profile werewolf, but player 7 considers player 2 as good, which contradicts my judgment. Moreover, there's no issue with player 4 siding with player 3 after receiving a good identity. Given that player 3's speech had no flaws, player 7's blind assumption that 3 and 4 are both werewolves is inappropriate. I believe player 7 is likely pretending to be a seer.\n\nBased on these points, I believe player 3 is the seer, and player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 7.",
