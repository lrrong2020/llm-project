I believe Player 6 is likely a good player killed by werewolves at night, because without the Witch's potion, there's no benefit for Player 6 to be a werewolf who killed themselves! Player 3, who spoke earlier, claimed to be a villager but their speech was somewhat vague.

However, Player 3 didn't \"make a move\" against me, so I have a slightly positive impression of them and think they're more likely to be a villager. I believe Player 5, as a werewolf, will probably pretend to be the Seer right away, because if Player 5 doesn't do this and lets their werewolf teammate pretend instead, I would immediately catch two werewolves! This round, I ask all good players to vote with me for Player 5. After nightfall, I will check a suspected werewolf.

When I woke up and saw that my verified good identity had been killed, I felt like the sky was falling. Those despicable werewolves actually killed my good identity. I'm also very dissatisfied with this speaking order. The werewolf actually pretended to be a seer before me and declared me as a bad identity. This makes me furious. No. 3 claimed to be a villager and their speech was rather vague, but I think No. 3 is likely a good person. Because No. 4, a werewolf with information, directly considered No. 3 as a good person, No. 3 is probably a good person exposed by No. 4. Today, I urge all good people to join me in voting out No. 4, the werewolf. As the Seer, my responsibility is to use my verification ability to lead the good people to victory.

Instead, it's like a cold machine mechanically outputting formatted text, which makes it impossible for me to believe No.5 is the seer! In contrast, No.4's speech was upright, eloquent, and well-reasoned. No.4 said, \"I analyzed that if No.3 and No.5 were both werewolves, No.3 would likely have immediately claimed to be the seer and identified me as a bad identity. However, No.3 didn't 'make a move' on me, so I have a slightly positive impression of No.3 and think they're more likely to be a villager.\" This statement proves that No.4 has the perspective and thought process of a seer. No.4 used scientific and rigorous logical reasoning to conclude that No.3 is likely a good player, which I find admirable.

Player 4's speech carefully analyzes the situation on the field, showing a seer's perspective. The strength of checking player 5, who immediately claimed to be a seer after being checked, is very high. Player 4 is likely the true seer.\n- **Player 5**: After receiving a bad identity check from player 4, immediately claimed to be a seer and gave player 6 a good identity. The strength of this check is much weaker than player 4's. Player 5 seems to be intentionally giving a good identity to the already eliminated player 6, appearing to be a werewolf pretending to be a seer to gain the trust of good people.\n\nBased on the above, I believe player 4 is the true seer.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 5 > 4\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 5.",

Despite being accused by Player 4 who spoke earlier, Player 5 didn't express suspicion towards other later-speaking players like 7, 1, and 2. This lack of a Seer's perspective is notable. If Player 5 were the real Seer, they should have been suspicious of the later-speaking players, as Player 4's accurate accusation suggests a high probability of their werewolf teammate being among the later speakers.

From the logic and content of their speeches, I believe player 4 is slightly more convincing. I can't agree with player 5's reasoning for defining player 3 as a good person based on player 4's assessment. If player 5 were the real seer, in their view, player 4 would be a werewolf, so player 4 giving player 3 a good identity could also be players 3 and 4 as werewolves establishing their identities. Player 5 shouldn't define player 3's identity based on player 4's definition. Additionally, as a seer who received a bad identity check and immediately claimed to be the seer, player 5's verification information lacks credibility, whereas player 4's has more weight.
