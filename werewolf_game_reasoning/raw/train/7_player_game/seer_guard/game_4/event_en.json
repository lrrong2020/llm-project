Addressing player 1, if you don't know how to fabricate your thought process, there's no need to spout nonsense. Saying things like \"My thought process for checking player 5 was that 5 is my lucky number, I was aiming for a good identity\" - I can't help but laugh hearing that. You even brought up lucky numbers for checking someone! Moreover, if you were the Seer, how could you aim for a good identity? If you checked and found a good identity, and the werewolves played a submissive strategy with you, should we blindly vote out innocent people? While others enjoy petting and cuddling cats, you, player 1, seem to be fondling wolf fur every day. From now on, you can pet and cuddle wolves! Player 1's speech has already spiraled into a mistake-ridden mess. I don't know if you're doing this intentionally or accidentally, but your every purpose is to elevate the status of your werewolf teammate, player 5, even trying to make them an \"invincible wolf\"! The malicious intentions and cunning tactics of players 1 and 5 are truly astounding! Today, I urge all the good people to join me in unanimously voting out player 5, the confirmed werewolf. To player 4, the Guard, I hope you can achieve a peaceful night by outmaneuvering the werewolves.

So Player 5 and Player 6 are not on the same werewolf team. If there's a case of a werewolf lynching their teammate, it can only be Player 1 and Player 5.\n- Second scenario: Player 2 was the real seer who was eliminated, and both Player 1 and Player 6 are werewolves trying to vote out the innocent Player 5.\n- In both scenarios, Player 1 is likely to be a werewolf.\nTherefore, I conclude that Player 1 is a werewolf.
