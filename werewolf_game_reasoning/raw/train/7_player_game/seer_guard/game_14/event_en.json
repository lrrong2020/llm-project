It's important to note that a peaceful night resulting from the witch's rescue is fundamentally different from one caused by the guard's protection on the first night. Werewolves are unlikely to risk killing one of their own to gamble on the guard's random protection - it's too risky and almost impossible to succeed. Player 6 claimed to be the guard in the first speaking position, and with no one challenging this claim, I believe 6 is the real guard. Player 7's speech was standard, without any notable mistakes or particularly impressive points. For now, I consider 7 to be either a werewolf pretending to be a seer or the real seer. Let's listen to the statements from players in later positions who also claim to be the seer. I'll choose which side to support based on their speeches.",

In the earlier speaking positions, No. 7 claimed to be the Seer and declared No. 1 as a good identity. However, after receiving this information, No. 1 didn't immediately side with No. 7. In No. 1's speech, they mentioned \"No. 7's view that No. 6 might be a werewolf doesn't align with my opinion.\" This statement indirectly suggests that No. 1 likely doesn't know No. 7, so No. 1 is probably a good person.

After hearing player 1's speech and seeing their vote yesterday, I was furious! After receiving my confirmation of their good identity, player 1 not only showed no gratitude but even distorted my words, claiming I suspected player 6 of being a werewolf. Yesterday, I merely said there was no need to distinguish player 6's identity, nothing more!\n\nImpressive, truly impressive. Player 4 is playing so deviously. Knowing that the guard was killed on the first night, they boldly declared player 5, their werewolf teammate, as having a bad identity, intending to vote them out. Player 5 cooperated perfectly, immediately understanding player 4's strategy and pretending to be the guard. After player 5 is eliminated, they plan to kill guard player 6 at night, leaving me, the seer, unable to defend myself tomorrow. What a brilliant strategy!\n\nIn this game, player 4, I willingly accept defeat to you for executing such a tactic! Actually, when player 4 pretended to be the seer yesterday, they were already sending a message to their werewolf teammate, player 5. Player 4 said, \"The situation is very clear now. Player 5, please repent! If you admit to being a werewolf, I'll mercifully leave your body intact!\" This was an obvious cue for their werewolf teammate to confess. If the good people can't see through this, I'm at a loss!\n\nPlayer 4 also claimed they wouldn't be voted out unless they pretended to be the seer, which is completely false logic. Werewolves can do whatever they want; there's no rule that not doing something automatically makes you a good person!\n\nI implore all good people to carefully review player 4's speech. As a seer, I've broken down the werewolf team's strategy in great detail. I've clearly pointed out their traces of revealing themselves as werewolves. Please, all good people, open your eyes wide, see through player 4's schemes, and vote them out!",
