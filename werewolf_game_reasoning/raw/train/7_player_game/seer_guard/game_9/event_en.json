I think player 6's vague speech cannot define their identity, and player 7 directly considering player 6 as a villager differs from my viewpoint.\n\n- Player 2: Claims to be the seer, declares player 3 as good identity, believes player 1 is good, and cannot define player 6. This aligns with my definition of player 6's identity, and they also judged player 1's identity. I believe players 1 and 2 have no connection.\n\nBased on these points, I believe player 2 is the seer, and player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 7.",

If Player 7 were a werewolf, given Player 6's weak opening speech, Player 7 could have easily declared Player 6 as bad identity and then attacked Player 6's weak speech, which would likely have led to Player 6 being voted out. However, Player 7 didn't do this.\n- **Player 2**: Declared Player 3 as good identity. Their speech was very formulaic, and they directly assumed that Player 7's declaration of Player 1 as bad identity was from a good player.\n- As I'm the last to speak, I've noticed that most players are siding with Player 2, while Player 7 seems more like a Seer without team support. Generally, if Player 7 were a werewolf, there would surely be werewolf teammates in later positions helping them, rather than leaving them isolated as they are now.\n- After comprehensive analysis, Player 7 is more likely to be the real Seer.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe voting for Player 1, who was declared as bad identity by Player 7, is the better choice this round.",
