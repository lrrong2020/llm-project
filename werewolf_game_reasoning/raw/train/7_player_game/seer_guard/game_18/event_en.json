Some newcomers might think, \"If Player 3 is a werewolf, why didn't they claim a bad identity for a player in a later position to challenge the real Seer? There are only two players after Player 3, giving a high probability of hitting the real Seer!\" I want to say, even if Player 3 had claimed me as a bad identity, what credibility would that have? The werewolf pretending to be a Seer can claim whatever they want, and it's not my concern! I believe Player 7 is the Guard. The speeches of Players 1 and 2 in earlier positions were fine, so I tentatively consider them as good people. Player 4's speech was rather strange, directly not siding with Player 3.
