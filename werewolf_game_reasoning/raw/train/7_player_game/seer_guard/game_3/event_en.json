From what I can see, there are still 2 villagers and 2 special roles left on the field. Let's join hands and work together to expel the werewolves who are destroying our home!

So, I believe one of them is the seer and the other is a werewolf, meaning we need to distinguish the real seer between No. 6 and No. 7 today. I think No. 7 seems more like the seer because their logic in considering me a good player is correct from a seer's perspective. Also, No. 7 directly attacked No. 4, essentially giving up No. 4's vote. I don't think No. 7 would operate this way if they were a werewolf, unless No. 4 is No. 7's fellow werewolf. Another point is that I find No. 6's speech too slick, with rehearsed-sounding arguments that lack sincerity, feeling more like a werewolf.",

Player 7 doesn't dare to attack player 2, the true guard, so they can only attack player 4, a villager, as a werewolf.\nBased on the above, I believe player 6 is the true seer, and we'll make judgments based on this.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 7**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 6.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 7, the werewolf.",
