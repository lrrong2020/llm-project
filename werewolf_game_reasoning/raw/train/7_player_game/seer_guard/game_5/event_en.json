We drank merrily to celebrate the harvest. Little did I know that the next day I would receive the terrible news that Player 6 had been killed by werewolves! Player 6's image and laughter linger in my mind. How could the werewolves bear to kill such a diligent and frugal villager?! I swear to avenge Player 6!\n\nPlayer 2 gave Player 3 a good identity. I think Player 2's credibility is quite high, but Player 3 didn't make any comments about Player 2, which is a bit suspicious. Since Player 3's speech lowered Player 2's seer profile, I currently believe there's a 50% chance that Player 2 is the seer and a 50% chance they're a werewolf! It seems likely that Player 7 will claim to be the seer soon. I believe I can find the true seer in my heart, and today I will do my utmost to exile the werewolves!\n\nPlayer 4 claims to be the guard, and their comments about Player 2 are quite fair.

Moreover, if No.2 were a werewolf, claiming to be the Seer as the second speaker would be very risky. Therefore, I believe No.2 is not a werewolf but the real Seer.\n\nWerewolf possibility analysis:\n- Player No.1: First to speak, gave a vague speech, unable to determine their identity.\n- Player No.5: Gave a vague speech, believed No.2 has high credibility, but thought it was not good that No.3 didn't comment on No.2. No.5's speech is problematic. If No.5 believes No.2 is the Seer, then No.3 is the good identity verified by No.2. No.5 shouldn't question No.3's identity. Thus, No.5's speech is inconsistent, making them seem like a werewolf.\n- Player No.7: Believes No.2 is a werewolf, gave a brief speech, seems to be confusing the situation, very much like a werewolf.\n\nWerewolf possibility ranking: No.7 = No.5 > No.1\n\nIn conclusion, I think voting for No.7 is the better choice this round.",

We should try our best to vote out the real seer and gain an advantage for the werewolf team.\n- Even if both my werewolf teammate and I vote for Player 2 the seer, exposing our voting pattern, we can still argue that the eliminated Player 6 was the real seer. By making such statements, we can confuse the villagers' perspective. Therefore, we werewolves can confidently vote for Player 2.\n\nIn conclusion, if Player 2 is voted out, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf team. Thus, I decide to vote for Player 2.",
