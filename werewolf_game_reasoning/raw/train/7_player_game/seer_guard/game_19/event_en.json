Excluding the low probability event that Player 7 was the Seer who died from the werewolf attack, Player 4 is likely the real Seer. Meanwhile, Player 3, after receiving the bad identity, claimed to be the Guard without analyzing the possibility of Player 7 being the eliminated Seer. Their speech was very brief, unlike how a good player would typically react to receiving a bad identity, and doesn't demonstrate the mindset of a good player. Therefore, I believe Player 3 is a werewolf who has been identified by the Seer.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 3.",
