On the other hand, Player 6 immediately claimed to be the seer and declared Player 5 as a bad identity, which makes me feel that Player 6 might know Player 5 is a villager and wants to vote Player 5 out by falsely accusing them. Player 1, who spoke earlier, didn't provide any logical reasoning and simply believed Player 6 to be the seer. I suspect Player 1 must be a werewolf supporting Player 6, so Players 1 and 6 are likely a werewolf pair. For now, I'm siding with the seer in the later speaking order.

The Seer has no reason to address werewolves; the Seer's job is to communicate with good players, so they can side with the Seer and analyze potential werewolf positions. Player 6's statement can only be from a pretentious werewolf hinting to their werewolf teammates. I suspect Player 1 received this hint and chose to directly side with Player 6, who is pretending to be the Seer.
