So I decided to check Player 1, and to my surprise, I found werewolf fur. Player 4, who was killed during the night, must have been a good person.

I don't find this reasoning very convincing. The seer can check anyone they want, so player 5's explanation seems more like a deliberately fabricated reason! However, since player 5 spoke first, we can give them some leeway. At this point, I think there's only a 50-50 chance that player 5 is the real seer; they're either the seer or a werewolf pretending to be the seer. I'll pay close attention to player 1's speech!",

I strongly agree with player 2's intention to check player 1, because player 5, as a werewolf pretending to be a seer, could easily declare their werewolf teammate (player 1) as a bad identity to elevate their status, making it difficult for the villagers to identify the werewolves.
