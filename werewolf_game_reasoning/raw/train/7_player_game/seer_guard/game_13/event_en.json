Player 1's speech was too brief, completely failing to analyze the identities of the three players who spoke before, and showing no concern for the situation on the field.

Player 3's speech was noticeably richer and more comprehensive than Player 1's, analyzing each player's identity and roughly confirming the potential werewolf positions.
