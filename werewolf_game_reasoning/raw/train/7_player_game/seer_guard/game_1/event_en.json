If I vote for 4, it would be a lone vote and difficult to eliminate him.\n- **Voting for Player 6**: I accused Player 6 on the first day, and I also criticized him in today's speech, so voting for him is more logical.\nIn conclusion, if Player 6 is eliminated, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf team.

Claims to be the Guard and successfully protected last night, resulting in a peaceful night. Highly likely to be the real Guard.\n- **Player 6**: I am a villager.\n- **Player 7**: Eliminated on the first day. Ruled out as a potential Seer. Could be either a werewolf or a villager.\n\nCurrently, Players 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are still alive. Assuming Player 7 was a villager, either Player 1 or Player 4 must be the last werewolf.\n\n- **Player 4**: Speech focuses on analyzing logic and searching for werewolves, appearing to be a good role. Moreover, Player 5 (Guard) believes Player 4 is good.\n- **Player 1**: Gave a vague speech on the first day, siding with Player 3 (Seer). On the second day, expressed doubts about Player 7 being the Seer. Inconsistent in their support.
