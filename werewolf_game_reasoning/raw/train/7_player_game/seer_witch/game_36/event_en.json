However, after receiving the good identity declaration from Player 6, Player 7 chose to immediately side with Player 6 and stated it would be difficult to change their stance. Moreover, Player 7 expressed their intention to vote between the competing Seers before Player 1 even claimed to be one. In my view, Player 7 seemed to assume there would definitely be competing Seers, and regardless of whether the competing Seer identified a werewolf or not, they would still vote for one of the Seers. Therefore, I believe Player 7's speech directly lowered the possibility of Player 6 being the true Seer in my mind. In conclusion, I think there's a high chance that Players 6 and 7 are a werewolf pair, which leads me to believe that Player 1 is likely the real Seer.

This assumes Player 6 is the seer, which doesn't sound like something a civilian with no night information would say. Player 7 seems like a werewolf, which greatly reduces the likelihood of Player 6 being the real seer.\n- **Player 1**: The point supporting Player 1 as the seer is that they declared Player 2 as good identity, instead of declaring an earlier-speaking, less active player as bad identity. Moreover, their comment on Player 7 is quite objective. Although Player 7 indicated they would likely side with Player 6, Player 1 didn't immediately attack Player 7 as a definite werewolf. This demonstrates the thought process of a seer. I believe Player 1 is most likely the real seer.\n\n# In conclusion, I side with Player 1, and I will vote for Player 6 to be eliminated this round.",
