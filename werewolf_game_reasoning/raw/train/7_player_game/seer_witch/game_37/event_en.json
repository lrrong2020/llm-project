I believe player 7's Witch identity is likely genuine because if player 7, who spoke first, was a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, there would be no benefit and they would only be poisoned by the real Witch at night. Therefore, player 7 is probably the real Witch. I find it suspiciously coincidental that player 7 in the front position claimed to be the Witch and reported player 2 as their saved target, while player 2 also claimed to be the Seer and reported player 7 as a good identity! Thus, I can't help but suspect that player 2 might be a werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the witch's potion. Player 2 didn't want to expose their werewolf teammates, so they gave a good identity to player 7, who had already claimed to be the Witch, to gain player 7's vote. If the speeches from the players in the back positions aren't too poor, I will likely side with the Seer from the back positions.",
