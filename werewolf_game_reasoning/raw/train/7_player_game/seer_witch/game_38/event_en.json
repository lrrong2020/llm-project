Last night, I chose to verify the identity of a player near me, and the result shows that player 4 in the later position is a bad identity. Excellent! We have a great start for the good team, with the Seer in the first position immediately catching a werewolf. Let's celebrate! Today, there's no need for doubt. Player 4's elimination is inevitable because I have 5 good teammates (including myself), while player 4 only has two werewolf companions. After my earth-shattering, ghost-crying speech this round, my good teammates will surely be inspired by me and trust me without hesitation, for only I can lead the good team to victory!\n\nFrom the moment I received this card, I had only one thought in mind - to win, we must win, we must lead the good team to exile all werewolves. I believe this thought will come true in this game. However, since the Witch used her healing potion on the first night, after we exile the werewolf player 4, I will inevitably be attacked by the werewolves and eliminated. When that time comes, I hope that the other powerful god on our good team - the Witch - can take up this \"banner\" for me and lead the good team to final victory. After all, as a weak god card, I can only accompany my good teammates for one day!\n\nI'm addressing the Witch now: I am your true god role companion. Anyone else who dares to pretend to be a god role is definitely a lying werewolf. Please, Madam Witch, keep your eyes wide open and discern carefully! Although I hold a noble god role, achieving final victory in the game will definitely require my other three companions - the villagers. Voting is the only power villagers have. I'm addressing my villager companions: please follow me in exiling werewolf player 4. We can't let them disturb our village anymore!\n\nNow I'm addressing werewolf player 4: if you pretend to be a Seer right where you are, challenging my claim, it's tantamount to admitting you're a werewolf. You might as well send out your other werewolf companion to save you. This way, you'd have a better chance of voting me out today. More importantly, it would give the Witch a direction for her poison, allowing her to vote you out during the day and then poison your werewolf teammate at night. Haha, how delightful! I can already envision our good team's victory - in this game, today!\n\nLastly, I'm addressing the Witch card in the later position: I can't give you any substantial advice about your poison, you'll have to use it freely. I hope you can poison a werewolf correctly. Remember, you must use the poison, don't be afraid of making a mistake!\n\nMy other 4 good teammates, follow me in exiling werewolf player 4!",

Now we have identified both werewolves - Players 3 and 5. This result is a cause for celebration for the good team! I scoff at Player 3's insincere speech; your words are all filler, which proves your lack of confidence. A true Seer doesn't need to pad their speech like you do, because I deeply understand one truth: the masses have sharp eyes! The remaining Players 7, 1, and 2 are all villagers.

Given that the Witch still has the poison potion and can eliminate one player at night, I suggest we vote to eliminate either Player 3 or Player 6, who both claim to be the Seer. Personally, I'm more inclined to believe that Player 6 is the real Seer. This is because Player 3, who spoke first, identified Player 4 (who spoke later) as a bad identity, but Player 4 then claimed to be the Witch. If Player 4 were truly a werewolf identified by the Seer, it would be more beneficial for them to pretend to be a Seer and directly confront Player 3, rather than claiming to be the Witch. If Player 4 is pretending to be the Witch, they will either be eliminated today or poisoned by the real Witch tonight. Therefore, I believe Player 4 is likely the real Witch, and Player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch. Today, I will side with Player 6 and vote for Player 3.",

The players in the back positions - 1, 2, and 7 - are all good. I think the issue between players 4 and 5 can be resolved during the night.

This suggests player 4 is not a werewolf, so player 3, who declared player 4 as a bad identity, is pretending to be the Seer.

Even if No. 4 were voted out, the Witch would have no potion left, and No. 4's werewolf teammate could kill the real Seer at night. This would prevent the Seer from revealing the second round of verification information, allowing the second werewolf to successfully hide their identity. There's no need for No. 4 to pretend to be the Witch and No. 6 to pretend to be the Seer, exposing both werewolves.\n- Therefore, I conclude that No. 6 is likely the real Seer, No. 4 is the real Witch, No. 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, and No. 5 is the werewolf identified by No. 6.\n- I choose to side with No. 6 as the Seer.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for No. 5.",

If player 4 were a werewolf, pretending to be a seer and confronting player 3 would be more beneficial than claiming to be the witch. This is because even if a fake witch isn't voted out during the day, they would certainly be poisoned by the real witch at night. So player 4 is likely the real witch. Therefore, player 3, who gave player 4 a bad identity, is probably a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\n- Player 6: Gave player 5 a bad identity. Player 5 claimed to be the witch after player 4 did. Player 5 is likely player 3's fellow werewolf rushing to support them. If player 4 claimed to be the witch and player 5 didn't choose to counter-claim against player 4, then player 4 would be the only true witch in the game, making player 3's credibility as a seer very low. So player 5 was forced to claim to be the witch to support player 3.\n\nBased on this, I believe player 6 is the true seer.\n\nIdentity judgments for other players based on the seer's assessment:\n- Player 3: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 6.\n- Player 5: Given a bad identity by player 6.\n\nRanking of werewolf possibilities:\n5 = 3 > 6\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 5.",

Usually, because the witch has the special ability of poison, players claiming to be the witch should prove their identity by using the poison at night, rather than being voted out during the day.
