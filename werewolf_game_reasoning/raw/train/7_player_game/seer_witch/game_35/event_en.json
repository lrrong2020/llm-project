According to the autopsy results, player 7 belongs to the \"werewolf\" species, which clearly means that player 7 was a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive the Witch for her potion. So now there's only one werewolf left on the field. I think player 2's speech was too brief, player 3 claimed to be a villager but also gave a perfunctory speech, while players 4 and 5 could both potentially be the Witch. In my opinion, in a \"lone wolf struggle\" situation, the werewolf would likely choose to keep a low profile, pretending to be an ordinary villager, rather than claiming to be the Witch. Therefore, I suggest everyone vote between players 2 and 3.",

Surprisingly, No. 5 shows no hostility towards No. 4, so you two can settle your differences at night. I suspect No. 3 might be a werewolf. No. 3's criticism of the witch for not saving someone doesn't align with a good player's perspective. It seems No. 3 might have killed their werewolf teammate, No. 7, last night.

Player 1 said they would vote for Player 3 today, so Player 1 is also likely to vote for Player 3. If I also vote for Player 3, I estimate we can vote Player 3 out. If Player 3 is voted out, it will at least ensure that the werewolves continue to survive in the game, and I can hide and try to vote out good players. Therefore, I will vote for Player 3.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 3.",

Based on this, I judge Player 3 is likely a villager.\n- Player 4 claimed to be good, hinted at being the witch, but didn't explicitly state their identity, and also said they might be a villager. I think Player 4 could be a good player shielding the witch, or a witch hesitant to reveal their identity.\n- Player 6 claimed to be the seer and gave Player 7 a bad identity. If Player 6 were pretending to be the seer, it would be more beneficial to give a bad identity to a player still in the game rather than the eliminated Player 7. Thus, I judge Player 6 is likely the real seer, and Player 7 is probably a werewolf who killed themselves, leaving only one werewolf in the game.\n- Player 1 claimed to be a villager and analyzed the credibility of Player 6 as the seer, but Player 1 also accused Player 3 of possibly being a werewolf. Since I believe Player 3 is likely good, I think Player 1 is either a villager or a werewolf.\n- Based on this analysis, in my view, the suspected werewolf is either Player 2 or Player 1. Since Player 6, the seer, called for votes between Players 2 and 3, and Player 2's speech was too vague, I consider Player 2's identity less credible than Player 1's.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 2.",
