I believe that with only two werewolves left alive, there's no benefit for them not to pretend to be a seer. Combining this with my suspicion that Player 1 is likely a werewolf, I think Player 2, who didn't claim to be a seer, is probably a good guy.

I believe the speeches of No. 2 and No. 3 in the front positions were logically coherent, analyzing the current situation, and they are likely good people. No. 1's speech in the front position was too brief, making it difficult for me to determine their identity. It's highly probable that No. 7 will also claim to be the Seer, but I trust the good team can discern who the real Seer is. This round, I'm calling for votes to eliminate No. 7 as a werewolf.

With the recent werewolf attacks in our village, my ability could be a blessing to the villagers, leaving the werewolves nowhere to hide! Last night, I used my eyes to check player 6's identity. Player 6 is not a werewolf, but a good person emanating a golden light. Everyone can trust player 6, who might be a villager or the witch. However, player 4 is pretending to be me, deceiving the innocent villagers, and even attempting to falsely accuse player 7 of being a werewolf! Although I didn't investigate player 7's identity last night, given that there are only two werewolves in the village, and player 4, who is impersonating the Seer, is one of them, if player 7 were player 4's werewolf teammate, player 4 wouldn't have accused player 7.

Since I used the potion on myself, I couldn't eliminate another potential werewolf position. Therefore, tonight I will definitely choose one player among the civilian suspects 1, 2, 3, and 7 who seems most likely to be a werewolf and poison them. Because among you four, there must be one \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" who is lying and trying to get away with it! Among the earlier speakers, 4 and 5 both claimed to be the Seer. I find 5 more credible. 4 claimed that their verification process was \"Four-Seven Square,\" but forgive my ignorance, I've never heard of such a place. I think 4's reasoning seems made up, and 4 is likely pretending to be the Seer. 5 claimed to be the Seer and gave me, number 6 the Witch, a good identity. Their speech was well-reasoned, upright, and every word was like a pearl. 5's appearance is like a purple aura from the east; I believe 5 is a legendary Seer emanating a purple glow!
