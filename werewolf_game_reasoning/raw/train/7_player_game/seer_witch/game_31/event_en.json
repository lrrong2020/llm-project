Considering that no other suspected seer claimed the role before player 1, and given that I know my own identity is good, player 1's confidence in declaring a good identity for a later-position player is very strong. Therefore, player 1 is highly likely to be the true seer.\n- **Player 4**: A later-position player claiming to be the seer, declaring player 5 as a bad identity. Player 4 mentioned their thought process for checking player 5 involved \"going to May Fourth Square\". I believe if player 4 were the real seer, they wouldn't need any thought process to check player 5 in order.

The disadvantage is that it may expose our werewolf identity, making it difficult to survive. I judge that Player 4's speech can gain the trust of good players.
