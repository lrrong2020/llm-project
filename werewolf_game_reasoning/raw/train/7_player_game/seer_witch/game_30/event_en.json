Thank you, Player 6, for giving me a second chance at life. You can rest assured that I am definitely not a werewolf pretending to be the Seer who killed myself.

If Player 1 were good, I could pressure Player 2 based on probability, but I caught this big bad wolf instead! Player 1 directly assumed that Players 4, 5, and 7 in the front positions are all good, isn't this obviously trying to gain favor with the villagers? Player 1 made a mistake during their speech, saying \"The remaining Players 2 and 3 are likely werewolves, the Witch can use the poison as she sees fit.\" If in your view, Players 2 and 3 are both werewolves, why would you tell the Witch to \"use the poison as she sees fit\"? Shouldn't you firmly instruct the Witch to poison Player 3, whom you believe to be a werewolf? Player 1's perspective has serious issues, their own speech is unclear, undoubtedly a werewolf pretending to be the Seer! As for the three players - 4, 5, and 7 - that Player 1 identified as good, I believe one of them must be a werewolf! Player 4, in the first position, asked the Seer to help them \"win easily.\" As we all know, Werewolf requires villagers to work together to defeat the werewolves, how can one have such a lazy, carefree attitude of \"winning easily\"? Player 4 might be a werewolf laying low! Player 5 directly and unreasonably praised Player 4, almost elevating them to the skies. Player 5 might be a werewolf with honey in their mouth but a dagger in their heart, trying to charm the villagers! Player 7 is even stranger, not commenting on any of the three players who spoke before them, laying so low they're almost \"at their grandmother's house.\" Player 7 might be a werewolf laying low.

We can analyze and judge through player 2's speech. Player 2's speech stated that \"player 1 is likely to be the werewolf who self-killed last night\". After receiving player 1's bad identity claim, player 1, as the witch's saved target, should not be \"possibly a self-killing werewolf\" from player 2's perspective, but rather \"player 1 must be a self-killing werewolf\". I believe there's a perspective issue in player 2's speech, so I think player 2 is a werewolf. If players 1 and 2 were both werewolves, then player 1 would have known that player 3 in the last position is the seer, and he would most likely give a bad identity claim to player 3 in the later position, because at this point, giving a bad identity claim to player 2, his werewolf teammate, has no benefit.
