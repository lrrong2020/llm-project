Last night was peaceful, thanks to the Witch using the healing potion to maintain village peace, though we can't rule out the possibility of werewolves killing one of their own. I'm very dissatisfied with the speaking order, as my bad identity is pretending to be a Seer before me, declaring me as a bad identity. This makes me furious. I hope the good people will recognize me as the true Seer. If I were a werewolf, I wouldn't pretend to be a Seer right after being checked and then declare the real Seer as a bad identity. Therefore, I can only be the true Seer who checks identities at night. Today, I urge all good people to join me in voting out Number 6, the werewolf. I suggest the Witch hide their identity to prevent the werewolves from targeting all special roles. As the Seer, my duty is to use my ability to check identities and lead the good people to victory. After nightfall, I will check those I suspect to be werewolves.",

While it's true that in a game with only two werewolves, the werewolf team would be at a disadvantage if they kill one of their own and fail to deceive the witch into using the potion, I believe there's still a possibility that werewolves might take this risk to gain the witch's trust. I think we should analyze the logic and individual speeches of Players 6 and 7 to determine who the real seer is, rather than simply supporting someone because they were saved by the potion. Therefore, I believe Player 1 could either be the real witch or a werewolf pretending to be the witch. I support Player 6 because they identified Player 7 as a werewolf, and Player 7 immediately claimed to be the seer after being accused. I find Player 6's accusation very convincing. I think Player 6 is likely the real seer, and Player 7 is probably a werewolf who immediately pretended to be the seer after being accused.

Since Player 7 immediately pretended to be a seer in response, Player 6's claim is more credible.\n- **Player 7**: Player 7 claimed to be a seer in a later speaking position right after being declared as a bad identity. This claim is less credible. Moreover, Player 7 reported Player 6 as a bad identity, creating a mutual accusation, which seems too coincidental and less believable. Therefore, Player 7 is likely a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe Player 6 is the real seer and Player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer.

As I, player 4, am the real Witch, player 1 can only be a werewolf. Player 1's claim to be the Witch, supporting player 6, contains major flaws in their speech, stating that \"the first night's saved target is 100% a good person\". This deliberate mistake in their speech is likely an attempt to forcefully support player 6, making the good team believe that player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch and supporting their werewolf teammate, thus trying to protect player 6 from being voted out.\n- However, the current situation on the table shows that most of the good team is supporting player 6 as the real Seer, with players 1 and 7 being suspected as werewolves.\n- Player 7's elimination is almost certain, so there's no urgent need for me to reveal my identity and declare player 1 as a werewolf. I can quietly poison them after nightfall.\nIn conclusion, I will prioritize voting for player 7, who was identified as a bad identity by player 6, the Seer.",
