Player 2 concluding player 1 is good solely because they didn't idle clearly indicates player 2 has inside information. Among the good team, only the seer is partially informed, knowing only one player's identity, while werewolves know everyone's identity. Player 2 obviously belongs to the latter. Combined with player 3's strong and righteous speech today, I will definitely side with the seer in the later positions and follow their vote. Player 2 claiming player 1 is good might be a werewolf telling some truth to gain trust, so player 1 is likely a good person exposed by player 2. I'm a villager. Among the later positions 5, 6, and 7, there should be a seer, a witch, and a werewolf. This is the typical setup for a seven-player game.

Moreover, how can Player 5 be certain I'm a werewolf when they've only verified Player 6 as good and haven't heard my speech yet? Couldn't Player 4 be a reverse-hook werewolf?

If I were to turn against No. 5, they would likely still check me, leading to my elimination. Therefore, my best strategy in this game is to support No. 2, attack the logical flaws in No. 5's arguments, and gain the trust of the good players to vote out No. 5.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe voting for No. 5 is the better choice this round.",
