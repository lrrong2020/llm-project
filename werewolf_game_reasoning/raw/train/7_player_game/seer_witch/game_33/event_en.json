Last night was peaceful, thanks to the Witch using the healing potion to maintain village peace, though we can't rule out the possibility of werewolves killing one of their own. I'm very satisfied with this speaking order, as I, the Seer, can report my verification early on. I hope the good people will recognize me. Player 7 spoke first without claiming or pretending to be a seer, and their speech aligns with a good person's perspective, so I tentatively consider Player 7 to be good. Today, I urge all good people to join me in voting out the werewolf who is pretending to be a seer. I suggest the Witch conceal their identity to prevent werewolves from winning by killing all the special roles. As the Seer, my duty is to use my verification ability to lead the good people to victory. After nightfall, I will verify suspected werewolves.",

But then I thought, maybe No. 2 dares to speak so recklessly because they received a good identity check from No. 1. After all, before we can vote out No. 2, we must first eliminate No. 1 who gave No. 2 the good identity. So No. 2 has the right to speak carelessly! I think No. 1's speech shows a Seer's perspective, carefully analyzing the situation. I was originally going to side with No. 1 as the Seer, but given No. 2's explosive speech, I now think No. 1 could be either the Seer or a werewolf, and No. 2 could be either a villager or a werewolf.

Player 2's opinion that player 7 is a werewolf aligns with mine; I also think player 7 might be a werewolf who's not contributing much to the discussion. Therefore, I believe player 1's claim to be the Seer and identifying player 2 as a good identity carries significant weight.
