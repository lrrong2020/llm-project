Player 6, upon receiving this accusation, immediately claimed to be the Seer as well, which greatly reduced Player 6's credibility. Second point: Player 6 argued that Player 2 didn't dare to declare a good identity because they were afraid of identifying the real Seer. However, if Player 2 were a werewolf, declaring a bad identity for a later-speaking player would have an equal chance of identifying the Witch. These probabilities are the same, so the argument that \"Player 2, speaking early, only dares to declare bad identities for later players and doesn't dare to declare good identities\" is baseless. Considering these two points, I choose to side with Player 2, and I will vote for Player 6 this round. I won't comment on other players except Players 2 and 6 for now.
