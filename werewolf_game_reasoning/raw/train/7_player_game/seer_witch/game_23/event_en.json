Because I checked player 7, as the Seer I can only report the true information from my check. I hope the good players in the game can recognize me as the real Seer.

Player 1's statement that \"Although Player 6's speech was vague, I think they have a good person's perspective\" indicates that Player 1 knows Player 6 is the silver water. The phrase \"Of course, we can't completely clear Player 6 based on this alone\" suggests that Player 1 intends to defend Player 6 later, leaving room for their own survival. Moreover, Player 1's action of verifying Player 4 doesn't align with a Seer's perspective.

No. 2's attack on No. 1 and wanting to check No. 4 instead of directly defining No. 4 and No. 7 as a werewolf pair seems illogical to me. On the contrary, I believe No. 1, as the Seer, is compassionate and doesn't give up on anyone who might be good. I don't think No. 7's speech was particularly impressive. No. 7 said, \"This level of conviction should be enough to convince the good players,\" but I believe the strength of the verification is for other good players to judge, not for the Seer to boast about. Moreover, No. 7 didn't mention who they plan to check tonight, just randomly gave a good identity to one of the four players in the back seats, excluding their werewolf teammate No. 2, which isn't very convincing. Comparing the front seat speeches, No. 1's was much more substantial than No. 7's. Knowing that No. 2 and No. 7 are both werewolves, I'm addressing No. 4: please don't be misled by No. 2, the werewolf pretending to be the Witch. No. 5 is the Witch, I'm siding with No. 1, I believe No. 1 is the Seer, No. 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, No. 2 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.
