No. 2 claimed to be \"very happy with this speaking order,\" but I wonder what's there to be happy about speaking first? You can't hear any other player's speech when you're speaking second, so you can't gather any information. Is that something to be happy about? As we all know, the worst speaking position for a Seer is to go first. Otherwise, why would the term \"golden pretend Seer position\" exist? It's precisely because the last speaker can gather more information from the field and is more convincing to the good team! No. 2's \"very happy\" statement shows that they're either a player with shallow thoughts who can't contribute much even in the last speaking position, or a werewolf poorly pretending to be a Seer. To No. 2, the pretend Seer werewolf, next time when you pretend to be a Seer and speak first, I suggest you act disappointed or dejected, as that would better reflect a real Seer's mindset. No. 3's speech is even more ridiculous: \"I believe No. 2 is the Seer. No. 2's speech, both in logic and eloquence, is breathtaking. It's smooth and natural, precise in wording, extremely persuasive, convincing, and passionate, completely matching my image of a legendary Seer.\" How can No. 2's brief, sloppy few sentences be persuasive or passionate? I can't hear it at all. In my opinion, No. 3 is talking nonsense, stubbornly charging forward! If No. 2 is really the Seer and No. 3 is really the Witch in this game, I'm willing to accept defeat, because in my view, the possibility of these two being capable of playing Seer and Witch roles is only 10%. So, No. 6 must be the real Witch, and Nos. 1, 4, and 7 are playing the roles of villagers in this game. Today I will vote for No. 2, and the Witch should directly poison No. 3 at night without using the antidote. Then the game will end immediately with the good team's victory!",

Since we've deduced that player 2 is pretending to be a seer, player 5, who is competing with player 2 for the seer role, must be the true seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 5 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf competing with player 5 for the seer role.\n- **Player 3**: A werewolf pretending to be the witch.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 2=3\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 2.",

Player 2's speech is very brief, lacking the perspective a seer should have, and doesn't meet my expectations for a seer. Player 2's good identity, player 3, claims to be the witch, but their comments on player 2 are extremely biased. Based solely on player 2's brief speech, player 3 immediately sides with player 2. I believe player 3 is a werewolf with a flawed perspective, acting as a charge wolf for player 2.\n\n- **Player 5**: Pretends to be a seer, declares player 6 as a good identity, and votes for player 2. Player 5's speech is clearly superior to player 2's in terms of logic, perspective, and situation analysis. Additionally, player 5's good identity, player 6, also claims to be the witch, contradicting player 3. Comparing the speeches of players 6 and 3, player 6 is definitely more objective and aligns better with a good player's perspective.

Being first, you can't hear any other players' speeches and can't gather any information, which is definitely not something to be happy about. So Player 2's \"very happy\" comment suggests either they're a player with shallow thinking who wouldn't contribute much even in the last position, or they're a werewolf pretending to be a seer. I judge Player 2 is likely a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n- **Player 5**: Since I judge Player 2 to be a fake seer, Player 5 must be the real seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 5 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Judgments of Other Players Based on the Seer:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf competing with Player 5 for the seer role.\n- **Player 3**: Player 2's werewolf teammate, pretending to be the witch.\n- **Player 6**: Player 5's (the seer's) good identity, claiming to be the witch, is the real witch.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 2=3>5=6\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for Player 2.",
