Last night was peaceful, thanks to the Witch using the healing potion to protect our village. If there's a Witch in the later positions, please come forward and reveal your saved player to give the good team more information.\n\nPlayer 4 hasn't claimed any role. If they dare to claim Witch, the real Witch should poison them tonight. If they try to pretend to be the Seer on the spot, it won't have any credibility, and we should vote them out today. If they claim to be a villager, let their teammates try to save them, which would expose two werewolves. We should vote out Player 4 today, and tonight the Witch can poison the werewolf pretending to be the Seer, leading us to victory!\n\nThe first three players all claimed to be villagers without any special role claims. From their speeches, I believe these three harbor a deep hatred for the werewolves, which aligns with the good team's attitude. Werewolves wouldn't likely use such an exaggerated method to establish their identity. For now, I tentatively consider Players 1, 2, and 7 to be on the good side, though I'll need to reassess based on their voting patterns.\n\nToday, I urge all good players to join me in voting out Player 4, the werewolf.

Since the villagers are so eager to hunt wolves, I won't hold back anymore! I believe that players 7, 1, and 2, who want to hunt wolves, are good. Player 3 is pretending to be a seer, and one of the remaining players, 5 or 6, is also a werewolf. I anticipate someone will side with player 3, but I trust that justice will prevail. Given that player 3 spoke from this position, with three players yet to speak, the probability of him successfully framing a seer is only 33.33%.

The speeches from players 1, 2, and 7 before me were clearly nonsense, and since I know my own identity as a villager, one of them must be a werewolf in disguise! By process of elimination, player 6, who hasn't spoken yet, must be the witch. I suggest that the witch announce their poisoning target this round, allowing the seer to verify other players' identities. This strategy prevents the poison and the seer's check from being used on the same player, which helps to limit the werewolves' survival chances!

Yesterday, apart from No. 4 who pretended to be a seer, only No. 1 voted for No. 3, the real seer. So, I reasonably suspect that No. 1 is No. 4's werewolf teammate.
