No.3's speech was standard, something both good and bad players could say, so I can't define No.3's identity. No.4, without knowing whether No.2 is pretending to be a seer or is the real one, concluded that No.3 likely hadn't seen No.2 at night, and thus judged No.3 to be a villager. I believe No.4 is a werewolf. What does \"hadn't seen No.2 at night\" mean? If we assume No.2 is the seer and No.3 is a werewolf, No.3 wouldn't have seen No.2 at night either. This logic clearly doesn't hold up, so No.4 is highly likely to be a werewolf in my opinion. I'll make a final judgment after hearing No.1's speech. For now, I won't take sides. After comparing the speeches of the remaining players who might claim to be the seer, I'll cast my vote. I hope either No.6 or No.7 will claim to be the seer.

I believe if player 1 were a werewolf, giving a good identity to an outer position player after being declared bad by the seer would be too weak a move, unlikely to gain favor from good players. It's not a typical action for a werewolf pretending to be a seer.

Assuming player 2 is the seer, if player 3 were a werewolf, they still wouldn't have seen player 2 at night. Thus, player 4's logic is clearly flawed, suggesting player 4 might be a werewolf.\n- **Player 6**: Believes player 2's verification has strong credibility. This itself is faulty logic. Player 2's verification would only be considered strong after player 1's immediate counter-claim. Before player 1 spoke, there's no basis to claim player 2's verification was strong. Therefore, player 6's logic is clearly flawed. Player 6 might be a werewolf.\n- Since only one of player 4 and player 6 can be a werewolf, but both of their speeches are highly suspicious, I currently can't distinguish which of the two is the werewolf.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 2 > 4 = 6 > 1\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 2.",
