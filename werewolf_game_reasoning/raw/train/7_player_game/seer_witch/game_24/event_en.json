Regarding Player 7 who has already died, I believe that in a situation with only two werewolves, there's not much benefit for Player 7 to be a werewolf who killed themselves. If Player 7 was the Witch who saw themselves being targeted, they would most likely save themselves or poison another player. Therefore, I think Player 7 is very likely a villager killed by the werewolves. This round, I'm voting for the werewolf pretending to be a Seer in the later speaking positions.

I have two purposes for claiming to be the Witch today: first, to eliminate a potential werewolf spot for everyone, and second, to take a hit for my great Seer. The werewolves will surely try to kill me tonight, otherwise tomorrow will definitely be a peaceful night! Player 2, in the first position, gave me, the Witch, a good identity. I believe 2 is not afraid of giving a good identity to the Seer, which could lead to a \"reverse identity confirmation\". Player 2's verification carries a lot of weight, so I'm tentatively siding with 2. Let's hear from the players in later positions.

If Player 3 is not the Witch, then the real Witch among the players who haven't spoken yet doesn't need to reveal themselves and can simply poison Player 3 during the night. At this point, I think Player 2 could either be the real Seer or pretending to be one.

Therefore, I believe Player 2 is the seer. Player 4's suspicion of Player 2's seer identity is unreasonable. The earlier speaker, Player 5, shares my view that Player 4 is a werewolf, so Player 5 is likely a good person on my side. I think the werewolf pool includes Player 4, with Players 1 and 7 being the last werewolf and a villager. In a 7-player game, the werewolf pool is very easy to analyze.

Therefore, voting for Player 2 can make the villagers think I'm \"consistent in words and actions,\" temporarily concealing my werewolf identity.\n- Voting for Player 3: Since Player 3 claims to be the Witch and no one else is contesting this role, if I vote for the generally accepted Witch, it would expose my werewolf identity.\n\nIn conclusion, if Player 2 is voted out, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf team.
