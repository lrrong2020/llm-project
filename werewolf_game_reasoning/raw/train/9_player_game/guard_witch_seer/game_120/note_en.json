I think 1 didn't try hard to find werewolves, 1 might be a villager without night actions or a werewolf afraid to offend good players.\n- **Player 2**: Claimed villager, believed 9 (me) is likely the Guard, sided with 8 this round.

I think 4 ignored 3's speech about voting for Seer 8, but attacked player 2 as a werewolf, so I believe 4 might be 3's werewolf teammate, trying to vote out good player 2.\n- **Player 5**: Claimed villager, believed 3 is a werewolf who misrepresented 8's speech.
