Among those who spoke before me, only Number 3 questioned Number 8's identity as the Seer. Number 3 pointed out that Number 8 didn't check Number 7's identity at night, yet suggested the Witch poison Number 7, thus accusing Number 8 of being overly aggressive. However, Number 8 merely suggested that if the Witch had no clear target, she could consider poisoning Number 7, without explicitly demanding it.

No. 3 questioned No. 8's identity as the Seer, and his speech implied that someone in the later positions would definitely claim to be the Seer. In my view, No. 3 is hinting at his werewolf teammate in the later position to pretend to be the Seer, so I think No. 3 is a werewolf. If No. 7 were a good person, he should carefully analyze the situation and find the hidden werewolves, but No. 7's speech was perfunctory and lacks a good person's perspective. No. 5 shares the same view as me, showing independent thinking, so I believe No. 5 is a good person. From my perspective, No. 3 and No. 7 are two werewolves. I suggest that Seer No. 8 check either No. 1 or No. 4 tonight. As the Witch, I vote to eliminate No. 3 and plan to use my poison on No. 7 tonight.",

This means that the outer position players 8, 6, and 9 are probably all good people. Player 6, in the last position, claims to be the Witch, so Player 6 is most likely the real Witch. The Witch, Player 6, clearly stated that she wants to vote for Player 3. As a villager, I need to follow the Witch's vote.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 3.",
