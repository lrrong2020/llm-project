If their assessment doesn't match what I think a Seer should say, I might question the authenticity of their Seer identity.\n\nPlayer 4's speech logic is flawed, indicating they're a werewolf. In their speech, they said if the Witch has a healing potion, she should reveal herself, and they would protect her tonight. Given that player 3 was the only one who died, and you, player 4, as the Guard, have already stated that you didn't protect anyone last night, we can be certain that the Witch didn't use her ability. This means the Witch still has her healing potion, right? So why are you still saying \"if the Witch has a healing potion\"? From your perspective, the Witch definitely has her healing potion. Therefore, player 4 made mistakes during their speech, revealing themselves as a werewolf.\n\nToday, I won't vote for either 7 or 8. Instead, I'll vote for player 4.

Player 9 said whoever gives them a bad identity is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, which is clearly a werewolf's speech setting themselves up. As for Player 1's suspicious point, they directly defined Player 3 as either a villager or a werewolf. I'd like to ask Player 1 how you know Player 3's identity? Are you privy to hidden information? I noticed your speech didn't show much hostility towards Player 9. Could it be that you, Player 1, and Player 9 are two werewolves who communicated during the night? Player 1, you're also a werewolf in my opinion! I think Player 2's speech sounds like something a villager would say, very confused-sounding, much better than Player 1 and 9's speeches. Also, Player 4 is clearly a werewolf, because I'm the guard in the bottom cards. I don't understand why Player 4, a werewolf, would dare to reveal themselves - are they offering themselves to be voted out by the good team? I didn't guard anyone last night. I don't question Player 5's claim to be the witch; their information matches mine, and I'll guard you, Player 5, tonight. Player 6 pointed out Player 4's suspicious point, so I directly recognize Player 6 as a villager. That makes Player 8 the uncontested seer. Let's hear who Player 8 verified last night. If the player you checked has a good identity, then we should vote out Player 4, the werewolf, this round!",

But looking at today's situation, only the eliminated Player 3 could have been the Seer! Although the Seer is out, it doesn't matter. I, the Witch, will lead the team. We still have hope for victory!\n\nFirst, Player 5 is undoubtedly a werewolf pretending to be the Witch. However, I won't vote for Player 5 today. You, Player 5, daring to pretend to be the Witch shows your courage and bravery. It would be unfair to eliminate you during the day, so let's meet at night!\n\nSecondly, Player 6 pointed out Player 4's mistakes during their speech, and I think Player 6 makes a good point. The Witch definitely has a healing potion, not \"if there's a potion\" as Player 4 said. I believe Player 4 is a werewolf who knows the situation but pretends to be clueless.\n\nTo Player 7, the Guard, I hope you won't protect Player 5 tonight. In other words, even if you do, it's useless. I will definitely poison Player 5, the werewolf pretending to be the Witch, even if I get killed by the werewolves. If you, the Guard, trust me, try to outguess the werewolves. I will use my poison for sure. Good luck protecting the player targeted by the werewolves!\n\nToday, let's all vote to eliminate Player 4, the werewolf who has already revealed themselves through their speech!",

Based on player 4 being a werewolf, player 7, who claimed to be the guard against player 4, must be the real guard. In yesterday's speech, player 7 clearly indicated that he would recognize player 5 as the real witch and protect player 5 at night. Yesterday, both players 5 and 8 died. If the guard didn't change who he was protecting, player 5 can only be a werewolf who was poisoned, and player 8 must be the real witch who was killed. I thought player 9's speech yesterday was that of an innocent person, but the voting pattern determines everything. Players 5 and 9 voted for the real witch. Yesterday, only player 7 thought player 9 was a werewolf. Player 9 voted for player 8, which is enough to prove that he is a werewolf who pretended to be on the villagers' side.

Player 1 pointed out that Player 2 considered Player 1 as a potential werewolf in the first round, but in this round, Player 2 remained silent about Player 1, which is suspicious. Player 1 also mentioned that Player 2 was only focusing on attacking Player 9. Therefore, Player 1 wants to vote for Player 2 to be eliminated.\n- From my perspective, there's only one werewolf left in the game. Since both Player 1 and Player 9 want to vote for Player 2, neither Player 1 nor Player 9 can be the werewolf. I estimate that the majority vote this round will be to eliminate Player 2. As I protected myself last night, I can only follow and vote for Player 2. If Player 2 is not the werewolf, then the werewolf will kill me tonight, and the good team will lose. So I choose to vote for Player 2 to be eliminated!\nIn conclusion, I vote for Player 2.",

Their speech is well-reasoned and without logical flaws. I don't consider them to be a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 9**: Intends to vote for player 2 this round. Refutes player 2's statement, saying they voted without clearly understanding the witch's role. The reasoning is somewhat reasonable, and I don't consider them to be a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 1**: Intends to vote for player 2 this round. Questions player 2's statement, believing that player 2 blindly considered player 9 as good in the previous round, but is now attacking player 9, which seems like a werewolf looking for someone to vote for. However, the reasoning is not sufficient. I don't necessarily consider them to be a werewolf.\n\nAs a good player in this game, I currently can't identify who the werewolf is. Regarding players 1, 2, and 9, I can't determine who the werewolf is at the moment. If we mistakenly vote out a good player, it would be extremely disadvantageous for the good team.
