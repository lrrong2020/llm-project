To Player 8, you can fabricate sweet words to convince the good players of your innocence, but to me, you are undoubtedly a werewolf. I hope you don't pretend to be a seer right away. It would be better if your werewolf companion in a later position tries to save you, so I can identify two werewolves on the first day! I'll predict Player 8's reaction in advance, there are only three possibilities: First, Player 8 pretends to be a seer immediately, but do you think I would risk accusing you if I were a werewolf? Second, Player 8 claims to be the Witch or Guard, in which case I hope the real Witch or Guard in a later position will stand up and expose them. Third, Player 8 claims to be a villager and pleads innocence, to which I can only say your defense lacks any credibility! Today, regardless of whether any werewolves in later positions stand up to pretend to be a seer, please don't split the votes. Let's all vote to eliminate Player 8, the verified werewolf!",

Players 1 and 8 both claim to be the Witch, so one of them must be the real Witch, and the other is a werewolf. Player 8, being identified as a bad identity by Player 7 who is pretending to be a Seer, should have a more convincing role than Player 1. However, I find Player 1's speech quite assertive as well, so I won't try to distinguish between them. I suggest we vote between Players 3 and 7, letting the Witches resolve their own situation. But Player 1, if you are the Witch, you should understand that Players 3 and 8 can't both be werewolves. Because if Player 7 were the Seer who identified Player 8 as a bad identity, then Player 8, being a werewolf, could have easily pretended to be the Seer themselves or even claimed to be a villager. Why would they claim to be the Witch instead? So if Player 8 is a werewolf, they can only be Player 7's werewolf companion. Player 8, if you are the Witch, you would definitely vote for Player 7 with me, right? As the Seer, I call for a vote against Player 7.",

Calls for votes on player 7.\n- If player 3 is the real seer, with players 8 and 1 both claiming to be the witch, from player 3's perspective, player 8 (who was declared bad by player 7 pretending to be a seer) must be the real witch. However, player 3 still asks player 8, \"If you're the witch, you'll definitely vote for player 7 with me, right?\"\n- Therefore, I believe player 3 assumes player 1 is the real witch at night and doesn't dare to accuse player 1 of being a werewolf pretending to be the witch.\nBased on this, I believe player 7 is the real seer, and we'll make judgments accordingly.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 3**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n- **Player 8**: A werewolf identified as bad by player 7.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 8=3>7\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to follow player 7's call and vote for player 8.",

From your perspective as No. 3, you claim to be the seer, and I, No. 7, am pretending to be a seer giving No. 8 a bad identity. How can you not recognize No. 8's witch identity? It can only be said that your perspective as No. 3 is completely distorted, as if you have supernatural vision! Addressing No. 9, you're the only one claiming to be the guard, so you must be the real guard. I hope you can recognize my identity as the seer and not follow No. 3, who's pretending to be a seer, in voting for the real seer. As for No. 1 and No. 5, you're both claiming to be the witch. I believe you're both good people, but one of you is wearing the witch's clothes, shielding the real witch. This behavior is very good! However, in this round, I hope the good people won't abstain from voting. Let's all vote to eliminate No. 3 who's pretending to be a seer.

No. 3 is the real Seer, and No. 2 is No. 3's good identity. No. 9 is the Guard. So, besides No. 1 and No. 7 as definite werewolves, the last werewolf is either No. 4 or No. 6. Let me analyze why we voted for No. 7 in the second round yesterday. Yesterday, No. 1 and No. 8 both claimed to be the Witch, so one of them must be a werewolf pretending to be the Witch. No. 1 said they supported No. 7, so they should have voted for No. 8, who was identified as a bad identity by No. 7, especially since No. 8 was also claiming to be the Witch against No. 1. But No. 1 voted for No. 3 instead. From this, I conclude that No. 1's behavior can only be explained as a werewolf trying to vote out No. 3, the real Seer. Therefore, No. 8 must be the real Witch. No. 1 and No. 7 are both werewolves. I'll wait for No. 3's verification. If there's a bad identity, I'll vote for them. If no bad identity is found, I hope the Seer will call for votes against No. 1.",
