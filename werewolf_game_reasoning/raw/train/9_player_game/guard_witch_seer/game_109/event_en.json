If the protection information reported by player 6 didn't match the witch's rescue information, player 6 would risk being poisoned by the witch. Therefore, player 6 is most likely the true guard. Player 5 is hoping for the guard and witch in later speaking positions to come forward and explain the reason for player 2's death. I think player 5 is trying to trick the guard and witch in later positions to reveal themselves, so I believe player 5 is probably a werewolf.

However, I'd like to point out that the Guard revealing player 2's elimination due to overlapping protection isn't entirely beneficial, as it informs the werewolves that our good team no longer has the healing potion. Consequently, if the Guard protects the Seer tonight, the Guard himself is likely to be eliminated. I believe the good team is not in an advantageous position, so I don't want the Seer to waste an investigation on me.

Therefore, No. 8's verification of No. 5 as a werewolf must be true. No. 5 spoke first, and without knowing the identity of the eliminated No. 2, they asked the witch and guard in later positions to explain how No. 2 was eliminated during the night. I believe No. 5 is a bloodthirsty werewolf, desperately trying to identify the special roles to eliminate them at night. Analyzing No. 3's speech, they assumed No. 2 was the eliminated seer, but how could they be certain I'm not the real seer when I, No. 4, hadn't spoken yet? No. 3's assumption that no seer would claim the role after an earlier player did so reveals their werewolf perspective. Thus, No. 3 is a werewolf trying to protect their teammate who was identified by the lone seer. I believe the witch is present because No. 6, who claimed to be the guard early on, stated that No. 2 was eliminated due to a failed save-and-protect scenario. No one challenged No. 6's claim, so I believe they are the real guard. The witch, not wanting to reveal their identity, likely claimed to be a villager earlier. This round, I will side with No. 8, the seer. Today, I vote to eliminate No. 5, and I request the witch to use their poison on No. 3 tonight.",
