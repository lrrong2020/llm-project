You were the second to speak and immediately pretended to be the Guard, even stating that you wouldn't allow anyone to impersonate you. You threatened that if anyone dared to claim the Guard role against you, the Witch should poison them at night. This was an attempt to pressure the real Guard in the later positions to reveal their identity. You're clearly trying to play the victim card here! Player 4 has already made mistakes during their speech. You said your reasoning for checking player 6 was because they were next to you, but shouldn't the players next to you be 3 and 5? How did player 6 become the player next to you? Player 6, upon receiving a good identity claim from werewolf player 4, didn't blindly side with them. I believe player 6 is thinking like a good player, so I consider them to be on the good team! Today, let's all vote to eliminate player 5, the confirmed bad identity.

The fact that Player 6 didn't immediately side with Player 4 suggests that they likely haven't met before, so Player 6 is probably a good guy. I find Player 7's claim of identifying Player 5 as a bad identity very convincing, because Player 5 had already claimed to be the guard and clearly stated they would side with a player who claims a role later. If Player 7 were a werewolf, there would be no need to give a bad identity to Player 5, who was prepared to side with them. Therefore, I deduce that Player 7 is the real seer, Player 5 is a reverse-psychology werewolf who attacked their teammate Player 4 in advance and pre-emptively sided with the real seer, and Player 4 is pretending to be the seer. This round, I will vote for Player 5 along with Seer 7.",

Therefore, in my view, player 7 must be a werewolf. Additionally, player 9 claimed to be a guard along with player 5, so I believe player 9 is also a werewolf. Player 5, as the guard, is speaking so aggressively. How dare you werewolves challenge under such pressure? I call for a vote against player 7. I suggest the witch use the poison on player 9 tonight.

Player 4 was the first to claim the seer role, and their speech was standard, so I find no major faults and have some tolerance for 4. Player 8 directly sided with 7 but only analyzed one-sided logic, stating that 7 had no reason to give a bad identity to 5 who clearly supported them. However, 8 failed to consider that if 5 is the real guard, 7 might be pretending to be the seer and giving a bad identity to the real guard 5, intending to vote them out forcefully. 8's one-sided analysis and strong support for 7 directly lowers the credibility of 7's seer identity. Therefore, I believe 4 is likely the real seer, 7 is pretending to be the seer, and 8 is 7's teammate acting as a supporter. Moreover, 9 claimed to be the guard in a later position and strongly called for votes against 5, showing excessive purposefulness. This makes me trust 5, who claimed the guard role earlier, as the real guard. Player 9 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the guard. I choose to side with player 4 and vote for player 7.",

I believe No. 4 and No. 5 are not on the same team, unless No. 4 is a very pretentious werewolf deliberately mentioning their werewolf teammate. Assuming No. 4 and No. 5 are not on the same side, they can't both be werewolves. Since No. 7 accused No. 4 and No. 5 of being a werewolf pair, I think No. 7's logic is flawed, so No. 7 is not the real seer. Therefore, I side with No. 4 and vote for No. 7. Another reason is that if we side with No. 7 and vote for No. 5, who claims to be the guard and speaks very assertively, we risk voting out the real guard if we're wrong. This would be a greater loss for the good team than voting out a seer. In conclusion, I cast my vote for No. 7.",

Since player 5 has already claimed to be the guard and sided with player 7 in the early position, if player 7 were a werewolf, there would be no need to declare player 5 as bad identity. They could easily declare someone else as good or bad identity, and then vote for other villagers. If player 7 were a werewolf, this operation would clearly be low-yield. Therefore, I believe player 7 is the true seer, and their verification of player 5 as bad identity carries significant weight.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer:\n- **Player 4**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n- **Player 5**: A werewolf identified as bad identity by player 7 (the seer).\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 5=4\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 5.",

Since the werewolves killed No. 8 on the first night, No. 1 is likely the real witch who saved No. 8 on the first night, so they strongly believe No. 8 is good during the daytime speech phase.\n\nPros and cons analysis:\n- Voting for player No. 7: The advantage is that the good side is likely to support werewolf teammate No. 4, so voting for the real seer No. 7 can help vote out the real seer, which is beneficial for the werewolf team.\n- Voting for player No. 5: The disadvantage is losing a werewolf teammate, which negatively impacts the werewolf team's future situation.\n\nIn conclusion, if player No. 7 is voted out, it would be more advantageous for the werewolf faction.
