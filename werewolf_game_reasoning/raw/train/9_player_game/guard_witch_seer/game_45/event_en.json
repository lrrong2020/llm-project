Of course, if either player 5 or 6 is the guard or the seer, this game will be quite challenging. I don't believe the witch would choose not to save themselves and use the poison instead, so players 5 and 6 are unlikely to be the witch. Player 1 gave me a good identity, and to be honest, I have a favorable impression of player 1, especially since they checked a player in their later position who hadn't spoken yet, and they weren't afraid of giving a good identity to the real seer. However, I must say that I don't fully agree with player 1. Let's see if there are any other players in later positions who claim to be the seer. At this point, I'm not entirely convinced that player 1 is the seer. If someone else claims to be the seer, I will vote for either player 1 or the opposing seer.

Firstly, Player 1's speech suggesting that two to three werewolves are among Players 3 to 7, and quickly concluding that Player 9 is good, seems hasty. Moreover, both Players 9 and 2 claim to be villagers, and knowing that I am a villager myself, if they are indeed villagers, then the villager pool is already full. Following Player 1's logic as a seer: Player 1 believes Player 9 is good, Player 2 is a good identity, and I am a villager, then there must be a witch among the remaining players, meaning the witch is also currently in Player 1's werewolf pool. Additionally, Player 1's comment \"I don't believe Players 5 and 6 are both werewolves, the possibility is too small\" is unnecessary for a real seer to focus on the identities of eliminated players. Therefore, I believe Player 1 is not a true seer, but rather pretending to be one. Furthermore, I doubt that Player 2, claimed as a good identity by Player 1, is necessarily good. The reason is that Player 2's statement \"But I must say I don't know Player 1\" seems overly contrived, almost like \"protesting too much.\" Let's hear from the remaining players; it's possible the real seer is already gone.",

Tonight, I will check player 2 for the following reasons: Player 2 believes that player 1's verification is convincing and their speech is fine, but player 2 clearly states that even if player 1 is the only Seer, they still might not side with player 1. If I were player 2 and a good person, in a situation where only player 1 claims to be the Seer and gives me a good identity, I would believe player 1 to be the Seer. So I think player 2's speech deliberately pretends not to align with player 1, which instead reveals a werewolf perspective. Therefore, I will check player 2 tonight. To player 2, if you are a good person, I hope you won't refuse to side with me because I mistakenly accused you. I will check you tonight, and if you are good, I will apologize to you tomorrow! Since I currently think player 2 is more likely to be a werewolf, I suspect players 4, 1, and 2 might be the three werewolves. I believe the players in the outer positions are all good (assuming player 2 is good, we won't look for the third werewolf this round, we'll discuss it next round), so I won't comment on them further. The above speech was based on the situation before player 4 claimed to be the Seer. Now that player 4 has claimed to be the Seer, I'm considering whether voting for player 4 can lead to their elimination. First, players 1 and 4 will definitely vote for me. I'm not sure about player 2's identity yet. If player 2 is a werewolf, because I attacked them, they have a very good reason to vote for me, so there might be three votes against me. I hope players 3 and 9 can vote with me. Although in my view, voting for player 4 or player 1 is the same, player 3 thinks player 1 seems like a werewolf, so voting for player 1 might be easier to eliminate them. Therefore, I vote for player 1 and hope players 3 and 9 can vote for player 1 with me. To player 8, I hope you can vote with me to eliminate player 1, but if you can't distinguish who the real Seer is, please abstain from voting and listen to another round of PK speeches.",

In Number 7's speech, they stood up and declared Number 4, their werewolf teammate, as having a bad identity, but in the end, they said we should vote out Number 1 (me). Everyone knows: if you have a bad identity to report, you focus on that. Clearly, Number 7, as a werewolf, doesn't dare to vote for Number 4, their werewolf teammate. This is the perspective they've revealed. Good people in this round, please don't split your votes anymore. Let's all vote out Number 7 werewolf unanimously, then vote out Number 4 and Number 8 in that order. This way, the good people will win.",

On the first night, I verified that Player 5 had a good identity, and last night I confirmed Player 4 as a werewolf! Player 1, here's a phrase for you: \"You brought this upon yourself.\" You're a werewolf, yet you dared to give me, the real Seer, a good identity? In this game, I took an unorthodox approach by decisively giving up the chance to counter-claim Seer against Player 1! I can only say that the process doesn't matter, what matters is the result. Sure enough, you didn't fool the good team, and you were voted out yesterday, weren't you? Looking at the voting pattern, I estimate Player 8 is the last werewolf! Player 7, you made a subtle claim and spoke sincerely. I can accept your identity as a good player. I think yesterday you felt that neither Player 1 nor Player 4 was your ideal Seer, so you subtly claimed to have a bad identity on Player 4, preparing to vote out the werewolf who gave the worst speech, right? Well done, that's exemplary behavior for a good player! I don't know if the Guard and the Witch are still in the game, but from the current situation, Players 5 and 6 should both be good. If either Player 5 or 6 were a werewolf, the game would end today by voting out Player 4. So, special role players, keep your identities hidden! In any case, tonight I will verify Player 8 to confirm their werewolf identity, and tomorrow we'll justifiably vote you out, Player 8! Today, let's all vote to eliminate Player 4, the confirmed werewolf. If the Guard is still in the game, please protect me.

Since I know I'm a villager, Player 8 must be a werewolf.\n- Player 4: Pretended to be a seer, claiming to have checked Player 8 last night and found them to be a good identity. I believe Player 4 is also pretending to be a seer and is a werewolf.\n- Player 7: Said they checked Player 8 last night and found them to be a werewolf. Player 7's information aligns with my expectations, so I believe Player 7 is the real seer.\n- Player 2 (me): This round, I choose to claim the seer role, saying I checked Player 4 last night and found them to be a werewolf. My purpose in claiming to be a seer is to confuse the werewolves' perspective, making it difficult for them to distinguish whether Player 2 (me) or Player 7 is the real seer, thus protecting Player 7 from being targeted. To make the werewolves believe in my seer identity, I must vote for Player 4 whom I've accused. If my words and actions don't align, the werewolves won't believe I'm the seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 4.",
