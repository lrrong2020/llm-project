Since all three special roles have been claimed, Player 1 can only be a Villager.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 9 is the Guard, thinks Player 1 is good. Since all three special roles have been claimed, Player 2 can only be a Villager.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be the Seer, says Player 4 is a bad identity, believes Player 9 is the Guard, thinks Players 1 and 2 are good, will check one of Players 6, 7, or 8 tonight.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be the Witch, didn't save Player 5 who was killed, votes for Player 3. Player 4 claimed to be the Witch after receiving the bad identity from the werewolves. If Player 4 were a Villager, they wouldn't rashly claim to be the Witch, as pretending to be the Witch would result in being poisoned by the real Witch at night even if not lynched during the day. Therefore, Player 4 is likely the real Witch.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be the Witch, didn't save Player 5 who was killed, believes Player 3 is the Seer, votes for Player 4.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a Villager, can't define Player 5's identity, believes Player 9 is the Guard, thinks Player 1 is a Villager, believes Player 4 is the real Witch, thinks Player 6 is a Werewolf pretending to be the Witch, believes Player 3 is a Werewolf pretending to be the Seer, sides with Player 8 as the Seer. Since all three special roles have been claimed, Player 7 can only be a Villager.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be the Seer, says Player 3 is a bad identity, believes Player 4 is the real Witch, suggests Player 9 (Guard) protect Player 4 tonight, thinks Player 7 is a Villager, will check either Player 1 or 2 tonight, votes for Player 3, suggests the Witch poison Player 6 or save an outer position player if killed. If Player 8 were a Villager, they wouldn't rashly claim to be the Seer, because from a Villager's perspective, I am the only Seer. A Villager wouldn't pretend to be the Seer and give a bad identity to the only Seer, so Player 8 must be the real Seer.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Villager\n- **Player 2**: Villager\n- **Player 3**: Werewolf\n- **Player 4**: Witch\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Werewolf\n- **Player 7**: Villager\n- **Player 8**: Seer\n- **Player 9**: Guard\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 4.",
