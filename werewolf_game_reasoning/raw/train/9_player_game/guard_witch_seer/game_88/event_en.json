How do you expect to find the hidden werewolves on the field if you're checking for good people, Number 6? Number 6 also said they never expected to find a werewolf. As a seer, discovering a werewolf should be exciting and pleasing, but your reaction seems to be very surprised, as if you're unwilling! I think Number 6's behavior is a bit off, but the fact that 6 could declare Number 5, who is in the last speaking position, as a bad identity does carry some weight. I'm not choosing sides for now; the possibility of 6 being the seer is about fifty-fifty. I'll wait and see if any other players claim to be the seer later!",

No. 8's attack on No. 6 for verifying a good player doesn't align with a Seer's mindset of finding werewolves. I think No. 8 is using false logic to strongly accuse No. 6, because verifying a good identity also helps narrow down the werewolves' living space. I don't see any issues with No. 6's speech. Among those who spoke before me, only No. 6 has claimed to be the Seer, giving No. 5 a bad identity. Without hearing No. 5's speech yet, I think No. 6 could be either the Seer or a werewolf, while No. 8 could be a villager or a werewolf. No. 1 thinks No. 8 seems like a good player, so I believe No. 1 could be either a villager or a werewolf. As the Guard, I won't vote now.

Player 7 claimed to be the Witch in an early speaking position without any Seer contesting, which wouldn't benefit a werewolf, so Player 7 is probably the Witch. Player 2 claimed to be the Guard but didn't side with Player 6 who's pretending to be the Seer, so I believe Player 2 is likely the Guard. I'm addressing all good players: the Seer's duty is to identify living werewolves, but Player 6 keeps analyzing the identity of the deceased Player 9. This shows that Player 6's perspective isn't that of a Seer, but of a werewolf afraid of revealing too much. Tonight, I will verify the identity of either Player 1 or Player 8.

Player 8's speech clearly shows they're a werewolf with inside information. So now we have all the werewolves identified: Players 3, 5, and 8. Player 3, also a werewolf, is strongly attacking Player 6, saying that Player 6 has been analyzing the identity of the eliminated Player 9, so Player 6's perspective isn't that of a seer, but rather a werewolf afraid of revealing too much information. However, I believe that Player 6, as the first to speak and claiming to be the seer, only has this much information to share, so of course they'd discuss what they know! How does this make them a werewolf afraid of revealing their perspective? Today, let's all vote to eliminate Player 5, the werewolf. I'm a villager!",

A seer should aim to check for werewolves. Checking for good identities only narrows the werewolves' survival space but doesn't directly identify them. Moreover, player 6 spent a lot of time analyzing the identity of the eliminated player 9, rather than focusing on the current situation. Therefore, I believe player 6's perspective is incorrect and lacks a seer's viewpoint.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be a seer, checking player 4 as a werewolf. Player 3 analyzed player 6's mistakes during the speech, which is logical. Additionally, player 4 directly accused player 8 (me) of being an active werewolf. Knowing I'm innocent, I can only assume player 4 is a werewolf desperately seeking to divert votes. This makes player 3, who identified player 4 as a werewolf, likely to be the true seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 6**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 3.\n- **Player 4**: The werewolf identified by seer player 3, supporting player 6 who is pretending to be a seer.\n\n# What I should do now:\n- **Vote for player 4**: Since seer player 3 clearly calls for voting player 4, to avoid split votes, I must follow the seer and vote for the identified werewolf, player 4.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 4.",

Since good players generally don't randomly claim to be guards as it confuses the perspective of other good players, player 5 is either a guard or a werewolf. Also, player 2 claimed to be a guard before anyone suggested they might be a werewolf, so player 2's guard claim isn't to prove their good identity. If player 2 were a werewolf, there's no need to expose themselves so early by pretending to be a guard. Therefore, player 2 is more likely to be the real guard, while player 5 is more likely to be a werewolf pretending to be a guard to hide their werewolf identity. This makes player 6, who gave bad identity to player 5, more likely to be the true seer.\n\n- **Player 3**: Gives bad identity to player 4. Player 4 hasn't claimed any special role but states they're a villager. If player 4 were a werewolf, they could have claimed a special role like player 5 did, which would be more convincing in proving they're good. But they chose to identify as a villager, so they're likely a real villager.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 3**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 6.\n- **Player 5**: A werewolf identified by player 6's bad identity.\n- **Player 4**: A good player falsely given bad identity by player 3 (werewolf).\n- **Player 2**: The guard.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 5=3>6=4=2\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 5.",

The speaking order is player 6, then player 3.\n\n- **Player 6**: Gave player 5 a bad identity. Player 6 said, \"I never expected to touch werewolf fur,\" but as a seer, finding a werewolf should be exciting and pleasing. However, player 6's reaction seems very surprised, which I find suspicious and unlike a real seer. Moreover, player 6 keeps analyzing the identity of the deceased player 9. Therefore, player 6's perspective doesn't align with a seer's, but rather a werewolf afraid of revealing too much through analysis.\n\n- **Player 3**: Gave player 4 a bad identity. Their speech was comprehensive and logical. Additionally, player 5 claimed to be the guard, saying, \"Tonight I'll protect you, player 7. You can use your poison directly. If the werewolves target me, don't worry about it. Just poison player 2 and don't let them see tomorrow's sun!\" This aligns perfectly with a good guard's perspective, so I believe player 5 is the real guard.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for player 4.",
