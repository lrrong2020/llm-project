Judging by the strength of their claims, 2 gave a bad identity to 1 who had already spoken, while 8 gave a good identity to a player who hadn't spoken yet. Also, 8 isn't afraid of being contradicted by 9 during the police selection. I believe 8's claim is more convincing, so I think 8 is the real Seer, 9 is a villager, and 2, who's competing with 8 for the Seer role, is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. Players 3 and 4 both claim to be the Guard. 3's speech directly attacks Seer 8, so I believe 3 is a werewolf with insider knowledge supporting 2. I will vote for 2 to be lynched today. The Guard should remember to protect me tonight to ensure a peaceful night tomorrow. If neither Seer 8 nor Guard 4 is eliminated, I will use my poison on werewolf 3, who's pretending to be the Guard and supporting werewolf 2.",

In my analysis, if No. 8 and No. 9 were both werewolves, No. 8 would likely not give No. 9, their werewolf teammate, a good identity, as it would expose No. 9 as a werewolf. Therefore, No. 8 is most likely the real Seer, and No. 9 is a true villager. Based on the assumption that No. 8 is the Seer, since No. 2 is also claiming to be the Seer, No. 2 must be a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. No. 3 and No. 4 are both claiming to be the Guard, but since No. 3 is siding with No. 2, the fake Seer, No. 3 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the Guard. This round, I will side with No. 8, the Seer, and vote to eliminate No. 2, the fake Seer. I hope No. 4, the Guard, can protect Witch No. 5. Let's work together as the good team to win this game.",

I think 2's declaration of player 1 (who has already spoken) as a bad identity lacks credibility. Additionally, 2's desire for the witch and guard to reveal themselves seems like a werewolf trying to identify special roles. Therefore, 2 is likely pretending to be a seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 8 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity assessments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer in opposition to player 8.\n- **Player 3**: This round, players 3 and 4 both claim to be the guard.

Suggests the witch and guard decide whether to reveal themselves based on the situation. Player 8 claims to be the seer and gives player 9 a good identity, while player 2 claims to be the seer and gives player 1 a bad identity. Judging by the strength of their verifications, player 2 gave a bad identity to player 1 who spoke earlier, while player 8 gave a good identity to a player in a later position.

So, I decided to verify No. 3 last night, and sure enough, they turned out to be a werewolf. I spoke first yesterday, and No. 7 was not my verification target. I can't define No. 7's identity; only the Guard and the Witch can corroborate based on last night's information. Any questions? No. 3, you directly stated yesterday that No. 7, a living person, was killed. How could I even respond to that? Make things up on the spot? How did you know that No. 7 wasn't a werewolf who sacrificed themselves? Today, No. 3 should be eliminated. I'll verify No. 6 tonight. I believe No. 7 was most likely a werewolf who sacrificed themselves because, based on yesterday's speeches and voting results, only No. 2 and No. 3 showed werewolf-like behavior. So, I think the game will probably end after we vote out No. 3 this round. If we enter the night phase, I'll verify No. 6.",
