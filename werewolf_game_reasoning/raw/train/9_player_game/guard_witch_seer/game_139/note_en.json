States uncertainty about Player 7's identity. Since I believe Player 2 is pretending to be a seer, Player 8, who is competing with Player 2 for the Seer role, is the real Seer.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be a Villager, trusts Player 8 as the Seer. Believes Player 8's declaration of Player 9 as good identity is very convincing. Since Player 9 is Player 8's good identity, Player 9 is a Villager.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 8 is the real Seer, considers Player 9 as good. Due to Player 1's vague speech, I think Player 1 might be a non-special Villager or a Werewolf giving an evasive speech.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Seer, declares Player 1 as bad identity, believes Player 9 is likely a Villager.

Believes Player 8 is the Seer and Player 9 is a Villager. Thinks Player 3 is a Werewolf supporting a false claim, believes Player 4 is the Guard. States intention to vote for Player 2 and use the poison on Player 3 at night.
