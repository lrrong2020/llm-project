If No.6 turns out to be good, then No.6 and I can put pressure on No.5 in the middle, tightly locking down No.5's identity! Last night, No.1 and No.3 were both eliminated. I believe one of them was likely the Witch who was killed, and the Witch, left with no choice, had to poison the other player! First of all, No.2 has already made mistakes during their speech. As a Seer, one should aim to check werewolves, but you, No.2, actually checked other players based on superstitious thoughts of wanting everything to go smoothly. It's truly laughable and ridiculous! You, No.2, are not working for the good side at all, but rather making up verification information with your eyes wide open! Secondly, No.2 asked the Guard to reveal themselves immediately and play with an open identity. I think in the situation where the Witch is likely out among No.1 and No.3, and given that the Seer must reveal on the first day, the Guard should stay hidden. You, No.2, actually asked the only remaining special role besides the Seer to reveal themselves directly. What are your intentions, No.2? This is clearly a crazy attempt to expose the special roles, which is unforgivable! These are the two major slip-ups of No.2. I believe No.2's speech completely declares that they're a werewolf, and can be eliminated today! To No.6, you've received two confirmations of good identity, making you the most trustworthy good player in the game. I hope you can recognize No.2's werewolf facade and not let the good players be misled. Otherwise, if I'm voted out today, it will be too late for the good side to remedy the situation! Today, good players should join me in voting out No.2, who is pretending to be a Seer. Tonight, I will check the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on the speeches and voting. The Guard shouldn't rush to reveal themselves, but should protect me tonight. I will report new verification information for everyone tomorrow. Let me lead the good side to victory!",

Given that player 6 is known to be good, if player 2 were a werewolf, it would be very risky to give a good identity to a player they haven't seen yet. Player 4, on the other hand, claimed to be the Seer later in the speaking order, possibly to avoid revealing too much information, so they simply gave player 6 a good identity to increase their credibility. Also, player 4 is trying to pressure me, so I certainly don't have a good impression of them. Of course, the final decision is up to player 6. Player 6, you can just call for a vote now.",

If Players 1 and 3 were villagers or the Witch, and if Player 2 were a werewolf, the werewolf team would have had an advantage after the real Seer (Player 4) was voted out on the first day. In that case, Player 2 wouldn't have needed to kill themselves last night, as the Witch was likely already out and couldn't be tricked into using the potion. Therefore, I believe Player 2 is the real Seer. This means Player 8 is the werewolf identified by Player 2. Today, Player 8 is pretending to be the Guard. I think Players 1 and 3 might have been villagers or the Guard, and Player 8 guessed that the Guard was already out, so they decided to fake being the Guard. So, Players 4 and 8 are werewolves, Player 2 is the Seer, Player 5 chose to side with Player 2 (the real Seer) yesterday, Player 9 is the Witch, and Player 6 has a confirmed good identity.
