Therefore, the werewolves can only be among players 6 and 9. Player 9's speech analysis revealed that player 7 attacked and questioned player 5's Guard identity by saying \"werewolves wouldn't dare to pretend to be the Guard,\" which shows a werewolf mentality from player 7. So between players 9 and 6, I think player 9 is more likely to be good.
