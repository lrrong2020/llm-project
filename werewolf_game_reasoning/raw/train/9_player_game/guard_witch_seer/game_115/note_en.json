I think Player 7 is like a werewolf who wasn't prepared to pretend to be a special role, so chose to give a vague speech.\n- **Player 8**: Claims guard, states they didn't protect anyone last night. Advises the witch not to reveal their identity. Thinks Player 7 might be a werewolf giving a vague speech or a villager with no night action. Suspects either Player 3 or 4 might be a werewolf. Since Player 8 is the only one claiming guard this game, they are likely the real guard.\n- **Player 9**: Claims villager, believes Player 8 is the guard. I think Player 9's speech is somewhat vague, could be a werewolf or villager.\n- **Player 1**: Claims villager, believes Player 8 is the real guard. Thinks Players 7 and 9 could be villagers or werewolves. Suggests the seer check Player 7 or 9 tonight. Due to Player 1's standard speech, I can't define their identity yet, they could be a villager or werewolf.\n- **Player 2**: I am a villager, I believe Player 8 is the guard. I think there must be a werewolf among Players 7, 9, and 1. I believe Player 7 is more likely to be a werewolf compared to Players 1 and 9.\n- **Player 3**: Claims witch, reports Player 4 as saved. Suspects Player 8 might be a werewolf pretending to be the guard. Believes Player 9 is likely good, states they will vote for Player 1 today and use the poison on Player 8 tonight. Since Player 3 is the only one claiming witch this game, they are likely the real witch.\n- **Player 4**: Claims villager, believes Player 8 is the guard, thinks Player 2 (me) attacking Player 7 is like a werewolf trying to lynch a villager. Because Player 4 is attacking Player 2 (me) like a werewolf, and is defending Player 7 who I suspect is a werewolf, I think Player 4 is likely Player 7's werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 5**: Claims seer, reports Player 6 as good identity. Believes Player 8 is the guard, thinks Player 1 might be a werewolf protecting Players 7 and 9. Believes Player 2 (me) is good. Suspects Player 4 might be a werewolf, states they will check Player 4 tonight. Since Player 5 is the only one claiming seer this game, they are likely the real seer.\n- **Player 6**: Claims villager, believes Player 8 is the guard. Thinks Player 5 is the seer, believes Player 7 is either a villager or werewolf, suggests the witch poison Player 7, and the guard protect Player 5. Since Player 6 is confirmed as good identity by Player 5 the seer, Player 6 is a villager.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgement:\n- **Player 1**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 2**: Villager\n- **Player 3**: Witch\n- **Player 4**: Werewolf\n- **Player 5**: Seer\n- **Player 6**: Villager\n- **Player 7**: Werewolf\n- **Player 8**: Guard\n- **Player 9**: Villager or Werewolf\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 4.",

Player 7 seems more like a werewolf intentionally speaking less in the first position to hide their identity.\n- **Player 8**: Claims guard, didn't protect anyone last night, thinks Player 7 is either a werewolf or villager, believes there's a werewolf between Players 3 and 4. Player 8 is the only one claiming guard, must be the real guard.\n- **Player 9**: Claims villager, doesn't comment on Player 7's speech, believes Player 8 is the guard. Player 9's lack of comment on Player 7 could mean they're either a villager unable to analyze information or Player 7's werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 1**: Claims villager, can't define Player 7's identity, thinks Player 8 is guard, Player 9 could be villager or werewolf, suggests seer check Players 7 or 9. Player 1's speech doesn't analyze who seems more like a werewolf, so Player 1 is likely on the werewolf team with Players 7 and 9.\n- **Player 2**: Claims villager, believes Player 8 is real guard, thinks there's a werewolf among Players 7, 9, and 1, considers Player 7 a low-profile werewolf. Player 2's analysis is very reasonable, likely a good person, probably a villager as all special roles are accounted for.\n- **Player 3**: Claims witch, Player 4 is silver water, thinks Player 8 is a werewolf pretending to be guard, will poison Player 8 tonight, believes Player 9 isn't on the werewolf team with Player 8, Player 9 is good, thinks Player 1 is a werewolf, votes for Player 1, will poison Player 8 tonight. Player 3 is the only one claiming witch, so must be the real witch.\n- **Player 4**: Claims villager, thinks Player 8 is guard, believes Player 2's speech is aggressive, thinks Player 7 might not be a villager. Player 4 attacks Player 2, whose speech seems good, so Player 4 could be a werewolf trying to defend against a good person, or a misinformed villager.\n- **Player 5**: Claims seer, Player 6 is good identity, believes Player 3 is witch, Player 8 is guard, thinks werewolves are among Players 1, 7, 9, and 4, considers Player 2 good, will check Player 4 tonight, votes for Player 1.\n- **Player 6**: Claims villager, thinks Player 8 is real guard, believes Player 5 is seer, thinks Player 7 is either villager or werewolf, votes for Player 1, suggests witch poison Player 7, suggests guard protect Player 5. Player 6 is my verified good identity and didn't claim any special role, must be a villager.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Werewolf\n- **Player 2**: Villager\n- **Player 3**: Witch\n- **Player 4**: Werewolf or Villager\n- **Player 5**: Seer\n- **Player 6**: Villager\n- **Player 7**: Werewolf\n- **Player 8**: Guard\n- **Player 9**: Werewolf or Villager\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 1.",

So, between the unidentified Players 2 and 9, I'll check one. Player 2 claimed to be the guard, which is obviously an attempt to confuse the werewolves' judgment, and seems more like a good person. Therefore, Player 9 is more likely to be a werewolf than Player 2, making it more appropriate to check Player 9.\n\n**Next day's speech strategy**:\n- Based on the information from my check, I will lead the good team to vote out the werewolf.",

Claims that they and Player 1 are werewolves. Votes for Player 5 as the Seer. Player 7 admits to being a werewolf, so they can only be a real werewolf.\n- **Player 9**: Thinks Player 3 was the Witch and Player 8 was the Guard. Suspects Players 1, 4, and 7 are werewolves. Believes Player 5 is the Seer. Votes for Player 7. If the werewolves are Players 1, 7, and 4, then Player 9 is logically a villager.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Guard. Suspects Players 1, 4, and 7 are werewolves. Votes for Player 7. Player 2's claim to be the Guard is likely to confuse the werewolves. If Player 2 were really the Guard, they would have counter-claimed against Player 8 on the first day.
