They said they \"verified\" Player 5 because it's a middle number, which is clearly a fabricated lie. I ask everyone, if you were the Seer, would you verify so irresponsibly? Moreover, Player 1 directly vouched for Player 9. Which part of Player 9's speech indicates they must be innocent? Player 9's innocent identity was given by Player 1's inside information! I'm addressing Player 9: if you're truly innocent, don't be blinded by Player 1. Siding with me is your only option. In my view, Player 1's address to the Witch is just seeking the Witch. I hope the Witch doesn't reveal themselves and simply use the poison on who they believe is a werewolf at night. I'm now addressing Player 4, who I verified as innocent.

I think Player 3's attitude matches that of a real Seer, so I believe Player 3 is the true Seer. If Player 3 is the real Seer, then Player 1, who also claimed to be the Seer, must be a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. If Player 5 were Player 1's werewolf teammate, Player 1 wouldn't need to give Player 5 a bad identity after Player 5 had already killed themselves to defraud the Witch's potion. So I believe Player 5 is a good player. Player 2, in the front position, immediately sided with Player 1 without listening to the players in the back positions, so I think Player 2 is likely a werewolf. Player 9's speech was very vague, so I can't determine their identity for now. Today, I will side with Player 3, and I suggest all good players join me in voting for Player 1.

As a seer speaking in an earlier position, player 1 directly considered player 9 as good despite player 9's very vague speech. I believe if player 1 were the real seer, they wouldn't easily define player 9's identity. Therefore, I think player 1 is a werewolf with information, knowing player 9 is good, and trying to gain player 9's trust through their speech.\n- **Player 3**: Player 3 gave player 4 a good identity. Player 3's speech was more cautious, and their analysis of player 1's mistakes aligns with my view. So I believe player 3 is the real seer.\nIn conclusion, I think player 3 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgment on this.\n\n# Identity Assessment of Other Players Based on the Seer's Information:\n- **Player 1**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 3.\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 1.",
