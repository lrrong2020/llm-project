No. 1 gave a bad identity to a player who's already out, and can't even hear No. 9's speech, so how can there be any credibility? You, No. 1, also said to listen to the witch's vote, so what if the witch votes for you? If the witch votes for you, will you vote for yourself? Is that what you mean? If the witch in the later position jumps up and votes for you, No. 1, and you don't vote for yourself, it's equivalent to admitting you're a werewolf, because you said to listen to the witch's vote. If you don't even listen to the witch's vote yourself, how can we good people in the outer positions listen? That's the logic, right? In conclusion, I think the possibility of No. 1 being the seer is less than 10%. Even if No. 9 is really a self-stabbing werewolf and No. 1 is the seer, wouldn't it be fine for you, No. 1, to be eliminated today? As long as the seer who jumps up in the later position doesn't make mistakes during the speech, I will directly side with that seer. No. 2 mindlessly sides with No. 1, so I directly identify No. 1 and No. 2 as a pair of werewolves. If there's no seer jumping up in the later positions, and No. 9 is that seer, then today I'll declare No. 1 as a bad identity and vote for No. 1. Do you all understand my meaning? If there's no player jumping up as the seer in the later positions, then I am the seer; if there is a player jumping up as the seer, then I'm not the seer, I'm a villager.",

I'm a villager. According to normal logic, player 1 giving a bad identity to the eliminated player 9 has no credibility. The werewolf team usually doesn't do things without benefit, so the possibility of player 1 being the seer is relatively high. Player 2's speech was brief and didn't claim any identity. I think player 2 might be a lurking reversed-hook werewolf, or could be a good person. Player 3 stood up and analyzed a lot, believing that player 9 might be a werewolf who was poisoned, and the guard protected the witch who was attacked. I think this probability is too low. Player 3 attacked player 1 for not analyzing this low-probability event, which seems like a forced argument. But if player 3 is a werewolf, given that player 1 is a \"coroner\" who checked an eliminated player, there's no need to make such a long speech to strongly attack player 1. It seems too contrived! Moreover, player 3 said no one in the later positions claimed to be the seer, so player 3 must be the seer. This kind of speech is beyond my comprehension. In conclusion, I determine that player 3 is a good person who talks nonsense and causes trouble, with erratic speech, and is unlikely to be a werewolf. For now, I side with player 1. Let's see if anyone in the later positions claims to be the seer!",

However, while Player 4 thinks Player 3 is good, I believe Player 3 can only be a villager or a werewolf. Player 3 might be good because they boldly speculated that Player 9 might not be a werewolf. Player 3 might be a werewolf because they treated their speculation as fact and forcefully attacked Player 1. If Player 1 is the real Seer, Player 3 could be either a werewolf or a villager. If Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, Player 3 could be a villager, or a werewolf intentionally attacking Player 1 to reveal their own werewolf identity, in order to elevate Player 1's status. Therefore, Player 1 could be either the Seer or a werewolf, Player 3 could be either a villager or a werewolf, and Player 4 is most likely a villager. Player 5 is a villager.

They considered various possibilities for Player 9's elimination, which clearly shows that Player 3 is a good person with a closed-eye perspective. Player 6, the Witch, you absolutely cannot vote for Player 3. Even if Player 3 wasn't my good identity, I wouldn't agree! Vote for me, Player 8, before voting for Player 3! Player 4's speech analyzed for a long time and finally concluded that Player 3 is good. Werewolves don't need to discuss so much logic to reach a correct conclusion, so I believe Player 4 is likely good. Player 2 directly sided with Player 1, very likely a werewolf charging for Player 1. Player 5's speech was vague, I can't determine their identity, so I choose to check Player 5 tonight. Player 7 didn't use their own logic to explain why Player 3 is a werewolf, just simply commented that Player 3 is pretentious. How can you insist on voting for Player 3 based on your subjective perception of \"pretentiousness\"? In my view, Player 7 is likely a werewolf following the Witch's lead to disrupt the situation! To summarize my speech: I am the Seer, Player 3 is my verified good identity, Player 6 is the Witch, Player 4 is likely good, Player 1 is pretending to be a seer, Players 2 and 7 are likely werewolves, Player 5's identity is unknown. Before confirming that Players 2 and 7 are definitely werewolves, Player 5 could be either a villager or a werewolf! This round, I call for a vote on Player 1!",

Player 1 completely ignored this point, so I believe player 1 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player 8**: Gave player 3 a good identity. They accused player 2 of being a werewolf, which aligns with my analysis of potential werewolf positions.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 8 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Judgments for Other Players Based on the Seer's Information:\n- **Player 1**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 8.\n- **Player 2**: Is player 1's fellow werewolf, acting as a charging wolf.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 1 > 2\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 1.",

Yesterday, when No. 6 Witch strongly called for votes against No. 3, if No. 8 were a werewolf, there would have been no need to take on the Witch's enormous pressure by claiming No. 3 as a good identity. No. 8 even bravely said that everyone should vote for him before voting for No. 3. Wow! No. 8 is so charming and heroic, this is exactly how a legendary Seer should be in my mind! I'm completely captivated by No. 8's courage, and I've decided to follow No. 8 all the way! No. 1 is pretending to be a Seer, No. 3 is a good role that I recognized yesterday, and today No. 3 claimed to be the Guard, so I definitely believe in No. 3's Guard identity. No. 5 chose to abstain from voting yesterday, and I consider this behavior as indicative of a good person. Today, No. 2 and No. 7 should voluntarily step up to the PK platform. Judging from No. 7's voting pattern, they are siding with No. 1 who is pretending to be a Seer, while No. 2 might be a deep-water reverse-hook werewolf.

If a good player is voted out during the day and the werewolves kill No. 3 Guard at night, the werewolves still have a chance to win. Moreover, No. 3 Guard is calling for votes against No. 2 and No. 7 for a showdown.\n\nPros and cons analysis:\n- **Voting for No. 2**: As the only werewolf left on the field, I can't vote myself out.\n- **Voting for No. 7**: I can only vote No. 7 out. This way, the werewolves still have a chance to kill No. 3 Guard at night and achieve victory.\n\nIn conclusion, if No. 7 is voted out, it's more advantageous for the werewolf team.
