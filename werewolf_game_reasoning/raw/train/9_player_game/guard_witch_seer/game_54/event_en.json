If Player 1 is the real Seer, then one of Players 7, 8, and 9 is a werewolf, and two werewolves are among Players 3 to 6.

From my perspective, Player 1 is a werewolf, Player 8 is the werewolf I verified, so I only need to find one more werewolf. Player 1's speech about wanting to verify Player 8, is that an attempt to give a good identity to your fellow werewolf Player 8 to protect them? Let me analyze the situation further. Player 1 gave a good identity to Player 2. Assuming Player 1 still has one teammate, and Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 haven't spoken yet, not knowing who the Seer is, they chose to give a good identity to a player in a later position. Player 8 is the bad identity I, Player 3, found. Player 9 seems to be talking but not really saying anything, so I can't define Player 9 clearly. Let's ignore Player 9 for now. So one of Players 2, 4, 5, or 6 is Player 1's teammate. Player 2 talks a lot like a werewolf, but I consider you to be a good person. I think Player 1, as a werewolf, wouldn't choose to give a good identity to their fellow werewolf, and Player 2 analyzes both sides from a good person's perspective, although they haven't clearly stated their position. I hope you can find me, the real Seer. Here's the plan: Guard, don't reveal yourself, just guard at night. Witch, poison Player 8. I will verify Player 6 tonight. This round, we vote for Player 1.

I think we should vote between the seer claims today, and you shouldn't split the votes.\n\nPlayer 3 says player 1's werewolf teammate wouldn't give a good identity to their fellow werewolf.

As it turns out, I indeed found a werewolf - player 7 is confirmed to be a bad identity! Since players 1 and 3, both werewolves, have already revealed themselves, I, as the Seer, am willing to be eliminated along with players 1 and 3. However, before that happens, I want to discuss the mistakes these two pretend seers made with the villagers.\n\nFirstly, player 1 thought player 8 was too aggressive, which is a clear mistake in their speech as a fake seer. Today, player 7 stood up and immediately wanted to attack player 8 without saying much. What's wrong with player 8 defending themselves? Player 7, a werewolf, stood up and said they wanted to \"lightly step on\" players 6 and 8, which is clearly an attempt to deflect suspicion from the good players without daring to fully commit - hesitant and timid behavior!\n\nPlayer 3 stood up and declared player 8, whom I believe to be definitely good, as a bad identity. Player 3 has also made mistakes in their speech. They thought player 2 seemed like a werewolf but then claimed player 2 was good. What kind of strange logic is this? If you, player 3, think player 2 is a werewolf, why didn't you check them? Why did you check player 6 instead, and how did you come to believe player 2 is good? Player 3's logic has completely fallen apart!\n\nThe situation is now very clear: players 1, 3, and 7 are the three werewolves revealing themselves. Let me analyze the werewolves' thought process. First, player 7, a werewolf, spoke hesitantly in the first position and was attacked by player 8. Seeing the situation deteriorate, player 1, another werewolf, quickly stood up to pretend to be the Seer to protect their werewolf teammate, player 7. Then, as player 2's speech was also poor, player 3, the third werewolf, feared the villagers might think players 1 and 2 were a pair of werewolves pretending to be on opposite sides. So player 3 was forced to stand up and declare player 8 as a bad identity, also trying to protect their werewolf teammate, player 7!\n\nToday, the villagers should not split their votes. We should all vote to eliminate player 7, the werewolf. Tonight, the Witch should use the poison on player 1. Tomorrow, we'll vote out player 3, and the villagers will win!",

We need to establish a logical starting point by first determining the identity of a certain role in the current situation based on logical reasoning, and then expand our thinking from there.\n\n- Logical starting point: I believe Player 8 is a werewolf. Player 8's attempt to test the witch's flexibility by deliberately claiming to have saved someone on the first night seems like a werewolf move.\n\n- If Player 1 is the seer: The werewolf pool includes Players 3, 6, and 8.\n- If Player 3 is the seer: The werewolf pool includes Players 1, 6, and 8.\n- If Player 6 is the seer: The werewolf pool includes Players 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n\nThis is a 9-player game with only three werewolf cards, so if Player 6 is the seer, the werewolf pool doesn't match the game setup. Therefore, Player 6 is a werewolf.\n\nSeer identity judgment:\nCurrently, Players 1, 3, and 6 claim to be the seer. The speaking order is Player 1, Player 3, and Player 6.\n\n- Player 1: Declares Player 2 as a good identity. Could be the seer or a werewolf.\n- Player 3: Declares Player 8 as a bad identity. Could be the seer or a werewolf.\n- Player 6: Declares Player 7 as a bad identity. Likely a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe either Player 1 or Player 3 is the real seer, and Player 6 is pretending to be the seer.\n\nRanking of werewolf possibilities:\n6 > 1 = 3\n\nBased on the above analysis, I decide to vote for Player 6.",

If Number 6 were a good identity, there would be no need to claim to be the seer. So Number 6 must be a werewolf. Number 4 claimed to be the witch yesterday and voted for Number 6, but Number 6 didn't die today. I'm questioning Number 4's witch identity. But I'm not the witch, I think Number 4 might have thought Number 8 was definitely a werewolf and poisoned them, or Number 4 might not be the witch at all. Number 5 didn't react to Number 4's claim of Number 7 being saved yesterday. If Number 5 was attacked last night, then Number 5 could also be the witch, thinking Number 4 reported the wrong saved player. Let's hear what Number 4 has to say. I still believe Number 1 is the real seer. Unless Number 6 deliberately exposed their werewolf identity to lower Number 3's credibility as a seer. Because Number 3 checked Number 8 as a werewolf but wants to vote for Number 1, arranging for the witch to poison Number 8, which doesn't seem like what a seer would do. If Numbers 3 and 6 are both werewolves, Number 9 seems to be a good identity that Number 3 dares not define, then either Number 4 or 7 must be the last werewolf. Number 2 votes for Number 6.",

I am the Guard, and tonight I will protect Player 2, the villager. Let's discuss Player 2. If Player 5 were the Witch, she would definitely poison Player 4 instead of Player 8 tonight, so Player 4 must be the real Witch. Let's also discuss Player 4. Yesterday, Player 3 claimed to have identified Player 8 as a bad identity but voted for Player 1, which doesn't align with my expectations for a Seer's voting behavior. Therefore, Player 3 cannot possibly be the real Seer from my perspective. Player 3 didn't vote for their own bad identity claim but instead voted for Player 1, who is also claiming to be the Seer. From my perspective as a good player, I see this: Player 3, a werewolf, gave a bad identity claim to Player 8, an early-speaking good player, but was unsure if Player 8 was a special role, so they voted for Player 1, the clear real Seer, to be eliminated. This behavior is hard for good players to trust. I believe that unless both Seer claimants only revealed good identities, one would only vote between the two Seers. If there's a bad identity claim, the priority would always be to vote for the bad identity, not for the Seer. Even if we assume Player 3 is the real Seer who identified Player 8 as a bad identity, if Players 1 and 8 were both werewolves and Player 6 didn't claim to be the Seer, the voting logic would be to either trust Player 1 and vote for Player 3, or trust Player 3 and vote for Player 8. This would create a 50-50 situation between a werewolf and the Seer. Player 6 claiming to be the Seer and drawing votes to themselves and Player 3 still results in the same 50-50 situation between a werewolf and the Seer, while also exposing themselves, which is very disadvantageous. Therefore, I don't believe Players 1 and 6 could both be werewolves. I vote to eliminate Player 6 this round.",

However, if player 8 is a werewolf, player 6's werewolf structure would exceed three werewolves. So I don't quite believe player 6 is the seer either. Unless player 8 is actually a good person, only then could player 6 possibly be the seer.\n\nAs a witch in this game, I still can't clearly discern the situation on the field. Regarding players 1 and 6, who both claim to be the seer, I can't determine who the real seer is. I think voting either of them out is acceptable. As long as the guard is present and can create a peaceful night by protecting the right person, we can ensure the good team maintains an advantage.\n\n# Werewolf Possibility Ranking:\n- 6 > 1\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 6.",
