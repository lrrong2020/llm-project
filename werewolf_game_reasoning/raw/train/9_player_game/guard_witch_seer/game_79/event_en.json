Moreover, Player 3 has already made mistakes during the speech. Player 3, if you knew what you said before was nonsense, why did you still say it? As a Seer, you neither mentioned who you're going to check tonight, nor arranged tasks for the special role players. You also didn't comment on Player 2, who accused you of being a werewolf earlier. Can you really handle the Seer role? Your attitude of deceiving the good team is already evident, completely making up a bunch of meaningless statements just to meet Player 9's Witch's request! Tonight, I will check the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on the speeches of the players in later positions and the voting information. Addressing Player 9, I'll believe you're the Witch for now. Since you still have both potions in hand, please cooperate with the Guard tonight to create a peaceful night.

Even if I assign tasks to other special roles, they might not necessarily follow through. So player 5, although you've said a lot, it's actually all nonsense.

First, looking at yesterday's two rounds of voting, Numbers 3, 8, and 9 had linked voting patterns, insisting on voting out Player 4. This raised a big question in my mind: Could Numbers 8 and 9 be on the same side as Number 3, who's pretending to be a seer? Player 4's speech yesterday was very relaxed, showing no signs of nervousness after being identified as a bad identity, so I believe 4 is a good person. But the behavior of 8 and 9 is completely out of character! You two, 8 and 9, both claimed to be the witch, and not only did you not vote for each other during the voting phase, but you even managed to use poison at night? If I were the witch and someone dared to impersonate me, I wouldn't even use the antidote at night, I'd definitely poison the impersonator immediately! Yet both of you, 8 and 9, survived, which is utterly ridiculous, laughable, and absurd! Number 3 is a werewolf, 8 is my bad identity, so 8 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch - this is now confirmed. And what's with your moves, Number 9? This round, I'll see if you vote to eliminate Number 8, and whether you still side with Number 3, the fake seer. I even think Number 1 might be the witch who was killed, while you, 8 and 9, are two werewolves, staging a fake show for us good people to watch, trying to solidify one of your identities as the witch, becoming an unbreakable werewolf that we good people can't figure out! Today, let's first unanimously vote out Number 8, my bad identity. Good people, don't split your votes!",

Number 4 received a bad identity from Number 3 but still thought Number 3's speech was powerful and eloquent. I think Number 4's behavior can only be that of a werewolf. Number 4's speech can be summarized as \"Number 3, why did you give me a bad identity? Then I can only declare that Number 3 is pretending to be a seer.\" So I suspect that Number 3 might be the real Seer who gave Number 4 a bad identity. Number 4 originally wanted to frame the real Seer but didn't expect to receive a bad identity from Number 3, which led to this kind of speech. Number 5, seeing Number 4's speech, could only stand up and pretend to be a seer, and today Number 5, pretending to be a seer, gave me, Number 8, a bad identity. In conclusion, I believe Number 9 is the Witch, Number 3 is the Seer, Number 4 is a werewolf, and Number 5 is pretending to be a seer.

I believe the werewolves are unlikely to skip killing at this point, so if Player 9 were the real Witch, there would likely have been two deaths last night. Therefore, Player 9 doesn't seem to be the real Witch.\n- In the previous round, Player 8 claimed to be the Guard and said they would protect themselves on the second night. Player 9 then said they saved Player 8 on the second night. According to Player 9's information, Player 8 should have been eliminated on the second night, but Player 8 is still alive in the game, which also proves that Player 9 is not the Witch.\n- Player 9's statements don't match the facts, and they're not attacking Player 8, so Players 8 and 9 can only be two werewolf cards.\n# What I should do now:\n- **Vote for Player 9**: Player 8 was already eliminated in the previous round, so I can only vote for Player 9 this round.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 9.",

Moreover, Player 8 claimed to be the Guard last round and said they protected themselves, while Player 9 said they saved Player 8. Player 8 wasn't eliminated due to the Guard and Witch protecting the same target, yet Player 9 still believes Player 8 is good.
