Therefore, I currently view Player 8 as the most suspicious and possibly a werewolf. Up to Player 9's turn, no one has claimed to be a seer, yet Player 9 didn't put pressure on the remaining unspoken Players 1, 2, and 4. I think Player 9 might be a werewolf or a villager. Player 1 isn't a seer, so either Player 2 or 4 could be a seer or a werewolf. If I were a werewolf, I could directly give a bad identity to Player 2 or 4, likely catching the real seer. However, my identity is good, so I choose to listen to Players 2 and 4. If only one of them claims to be a seer, I'll consider that Players 3 and 5, who were eliminated on the first night, might have been seers.",

Tonight, I urge the guard to protect me, ensuring a peaceful night. I will use my healing potion on whoever gets attacked among the later speakers today. It's possible that the real seer was eliminated among No.3 and No.5. If you don't trust No.2's brief but concise speech, then vote for No.2. No.9's speech was pointless, just comparing roles without reaching any conclusion. I believe No.9 is a werewolf. No.1 also suspected No.9 might be a werewolf, so I can vouch for No.1 being good this round. No one should vote for No.1! I'm reserving judgment on whether No.2 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer or the real seer. For now, I won't make a decision. If the later speakers think No.9 is good, then you can vote for No.2. As the only true witch in the game, I'm voting for either No.9 or No.2 in this final speaking position. Don't split your votes among the later speakers.",

Since Player 9 attacked me as if I were a werewolf, and their logic for suspecting me was somewhat simplistic, lacking the depth of thought typical of a good player, I believe Player 9 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player 2**: Claimed to be the Seer and declared Player 8 (me) as a good identity. Although Player 2 is the only one claiming to be the Seer, their speech was brief and didn't discuss other players' identities. Therefore, Player 2 might be a werewolf, and the real Seer might have already been eliminated. However, to maintain the possibility that Player 2 is the Seer, I decide not to vote for Player 2 this round and wait to hear their verification report tomorrow.\n\n# Werewolf Probability Ranking\n- Based on the speech and behavior analysis of Players 9 and 2 above, the conclusion is that the probability of being a werewolf is ranked as: Player 9 > Player 2.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe voting for Player 9 is the best choice this round.",

Also, they said, \"If I were a werewolf, I could directly declare players 2 or 4 as bad identities, which would likely result in declaring the real seer as a bad identity, but I'm actually a good person, so I choose to listen to players 2 and 4 speak.\" This logic of claiming to be good just because they didn't pretend to be a seer is invalid, as werewolves can also choose not to pretend to be a seer and use such reasoning to prove they are good.

I voted for player 9 yesterday because only player 2 claimed to be the Seer and gave player 8 a good identity. In my view, both players 8 and 9 could be werewolves, and player 9's speech on the first day wasn't good. Later, player 4 claimed to be the Witch and called for votes between players 2 and 9. If player 4 were a werewolf speaking in the last position, and given that player 2 claimed to be the Seer with such a brief speech, player 4 could have easily pretended to be a seer. But player 4 didn't, so I believe player 4 is the real Witch. Since I thought player 2 could be the real Seer yesterday, I could only vote for player 9. Player 6 died last night. Because there's only one claimed Seer, I didn't protect player 2 last night, but the werewolves didn't kill them, so I suspect player 2 might be a werewolf. This means players 3 and 5 are likely the real Seer and a villager. If player 9 isn't a werewolf, then the last werewolf must be player 7. Thinking back to player 8 and player 2's speeches yesterday, player 2 seems like a werewolf who pretended to be a seer immediately after being checked, trying to protect their werewolf teammate, player 8. So players 2 and 8 are likely the two werewolves. As the Guard, player 1, I call for votes on players 2 and 8.",
