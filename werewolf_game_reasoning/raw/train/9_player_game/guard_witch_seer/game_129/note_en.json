As Player 4 gave a good identity to Player 5 in a later position, and Player 5 is the uncontested Guard, Player 5 is clearly a good role. Player 4 gave a good identity to a later position, not afraid of being challenged, so Player 4's verification seems strong. Therefore, I analyze that Player 4 is the Seer.\n\n- **Player 5**: Claimed to be the Guard, reported no protection last night, supported Player 4. Since I am the Witch, Player 5 dared to claim Guard in an early position and confirmed the night information with me, so I analyze that Player 5 is the real Guard.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claimed to be a Villager, supported Seer 4, believed Player 5 is the real Guard. Because I can't determine if Player 6 is good from their speech, and I'm the Witch, Player 5 is the Guard. So I analyze that Player 6 could be either a Villager or a Werewolf.\n\n- **Player 7**: Claimed to be the Seer, reported checking Player 8 as good identity, believed Player 4 is pretending to be the Seer, Player 5 is the real Guard. Will check Player 2's identity tonight. Because Player 7 claimed to be the Seer but didn't suspect that Players 4 and 5 might be two Werewolves pretending roles, which doesn't align with a Seer's perspective. So I analyze that Player 7 is a Werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n\n- **Player 8**: Claimed to be a Villager, supported Player 4, believed Player 5 is the Guard, will vote to eliminate Player 7 who is pretending to be the Seer. Because Player 8's speech was relatively fair and showed a good person's perspective, and Player 8 still supported the real Seer despite being given a good identity by Player 7 (the fake Seer), so I analyze that Player 8 is a real Villager.\n\n- **Player 1**: Claimed to be a Villager, not taking sides for now, suggested the Witch not to reveal yet. Because I can't determine if Player 1 is good from their speech, so I analyze that Player 1 could be either a Villager or a Werewolf.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claimed to be the Guard, believed Players 4 and 5 are two Werewolves, will vote for Player 5 today, suggested the Witch to poison Player 4. Because I believe Player 4 is the Seer and Player 5 is the Guard, Player 2 claimed to be the Guard and supported Player 7 who is pretending to be the Seer, so I believe Player 2 is a Werewolf pretending to be the Guard to support Player 7.\n\n- **Player 3 (myself)**: Claimed to be the Witch, reported not using the potion last night, supported Player 4, believed Player 5 is the real Guard, Player 8 is a Villager.
