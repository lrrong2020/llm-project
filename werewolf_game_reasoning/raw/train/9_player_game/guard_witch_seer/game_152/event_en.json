Think about it: how would a Seer with a normal perspective know that their verified good identity would definitely side with them? As Number 5 said themselves, if they were a werewolf, they absolutely wouldn't give a good identity to a villager in the first position. So Number 5 chose to give a good identity to their werewolf teammate, Number 6. Today, we villagers should unite to exile the werewolf Number 6 that I've identified. The Witch should use her poison on Number 5 tonight. After hearing everyone's speeches, I will verify the player I suspect most of being a werewolf.",

Because if Numbers 5 and 6 were both werewolves, and Number 5 saw that their werewolf teammate's self-attack was successful, Number 5 wouldn't need to declare Number 6 as a good identity. The witch would likely protect their saved player anyway. I want to side with Number 5, and I think Number 7 is probably a werewolf pretending to be the seer. If someone in a later position claims to be the witch, I'll believe that later witch claim. Number 8 said that Number 6 immediately sided with Number 5 after receiving a good identity from them, without waiting to hear from players in later positions. But Number 6 already said that Number 5 isn't afraid of later players changing their stance during the police chief election, which shows that Number 5's verification carries a lot of weight. That's why Number 6 sided with Number 5. I think Number 8 is forcefully trying to accuse Numbers 5 and 6 of both being werewolves, even though Number 6 is Number 8's saved player. Number 8 isn't analyzing the possibility that Number 6 could be good at all. If someone in a later position also claims to be the witch, I'll consider Numbers 7 and 8 to be the two werewolves.

The werewolves are already on the offensive, so villagers, please don't be misled by their tactics. The werewolf suspects are No. 2, No. 7, and No. 8.
