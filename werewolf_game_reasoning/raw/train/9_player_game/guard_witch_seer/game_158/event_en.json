            "context": "Hello everyone, I am the only true Seer in the game. Last night, I verified that Player 2 is a werewolf. My reasoning for checking Player 2 was to verify someone near me. If I found a good identity, that player could help me find the hidden werewolves. If I found a bad identity, it would limit the werewolves' survival space. After hearing the speeches from the players before me, I've identified all the werewolf suspects. The three werewolves are Players 4, 6, and 2. Player 4 is the werewolf pretending to be a Seer against me, Player 6 is the werewolf claiming to be the Witch against Player 5, and Player 2 is the one I verified as a werewolf. If nothing unexpected happens, the little werewolf Player 2 will certainly claim to be the Guard. I hope the good players won't be misled by the werewolves. I am the real Seer. This round, please follow me to vote out Player 2, the werewolf. Player 5, the Witch, should use the poison to kill Player 6, the werewolf, tonight. Tomorrow, we can vote out the last werewolf, Player 4. Thank you.",

That's absurd and laughable! Today, after hearing your speech, all the good players and even your werewolf companions will join hands to exile you, Number 1. My speech will move all the good players, while yours will only incite public anger! Given that I know my own identity as the Guard, Number 1 claiming I'm a bad identity, and Number 9 pretending to be the Guard, I believe Numbers 1 and 9 are werewolves impersonating each other's roles. The fact that Number 1, a werewolf, confidently predicted I would claim to be the Guard shows they have inside information. I trust all good players can see that Number 1 is a werewolf with knowledge. I believe Number 4 is the real Seer. Number 4 identified Number 5 as a bad identity, so Number 5 is a werewolf, and Number 6, who's competing with Number 5 for the Witch role, is the real Witch.

There's no need to arrange for player 1 to pretend to be a seer, as this would expose two werewolves. Additionally, if player 5 were a werewolf, after being declared as a bad identity, there's no need to claim to be the witch, because the real witch would certainly use the poison on them. This behavior would have no benefit for the werewolf team. Secondly, player 1 believes that player 2 will definitely claim to be the guard. I think player 1 has their own judgment of the situation, which is consistent with the perspective a seer should have.

However, during the voting phase, I sided with Seer No. 1 and voted to eliminate No. 2, who was identified as a bad identity. My reason was that the faction division was very clear yesterday. Yesterday, No. 4 claimed to be the Seer, No. 6 claimed to be the Witch and supported No. 4, and No. 2 claimed to be the Guard, also supporting No. 4 while attacking No. 1. So I deduced that No. 4, No. 6, and No. 2 are on the same team. Yesterday, No. 1 claimed to be the Seer, No. 5 claimed to be the Witch and supported No. 1, and No. 9 claimed to be the Guard but didn't choose a side. Therefore, I believe No. 1, No. 5, and No. 9 are also on the same team. If No. 1 were a werewolf, then No. 5 and No. 9 would definitely be werewolves too. In that case, No. 9, who claimed to be the Guard early on, should have done some work for the werewolf team by attacking No. 4 to support their werewolf teammate No. 1. However, No. 9 didn't show any suspicious behavior and didn't express a stance. So I believe No. 9 is the real Guard, which means No. 1 is the real Seer, and the werewolves are likely No. 4, No. 6, and No. 2. Last night, No. 6 and No. 9 died. No. 6 was a werewolf pretending to be the Witch and was poisoned by the real Witch, No. 5. No. 9 was the real Guard who was killed by the werewolves last night. Today, I vote for No. 4, who I believe is a werewolf.",

The witch decisively poisoned the werewolf Player 9 last night, which I think was an excellent move. However, the despicable werewolves killed Player 6, the witch, which breaks my heart! Now I'm the only divine role left on the field, while werewolves 1 and 5 are still here. The good team is in a dire situation. To Players 3, 7, and 8, I hope you can come to your senses and not unknowingly support Player 1, the fake seer. Yesterday, you three were fooled by the werewolves into voting out Player 2, the guard. Don't continue making mistakes. Listen to my advice: it's never too late to turn back! Today, please join me in lynching Player 5, who I've identified as a werewolf.
