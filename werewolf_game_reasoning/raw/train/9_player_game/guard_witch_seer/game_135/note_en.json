Asks all good players to support them, suggests voting out Player 6 this round, plans to check suspected werewolves at night.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be a Villager. States they have no special skills, accuses Player 5 of being a werewolf. Believes the real Seer is among later speakers, suggests voting out Player 5 this round.\n\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a Villager. Distrusts Player 5 as the Seer due to lack of reasoning for checking Player 6. Believes Player 6 is good, supports the Seer among later speakers, suggests voting out Player 5.\n\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the Witch. States Player 7 was attacked last night, suspects Player 7 might be a self-killing werewolf, so didn't use the healing potion. Since Player 6 didn't claim a special role after being declared bad by Player 5, believes Player 6 could be a Villager or Werewolf. Not supporting Player 5 yet, believes Player 8 is a Villager.\n\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the Guard. States they guarded no one last night, believes Player 9 is the Witch and will protect them tonight. Trusts Player 6 is a Villager, supports the Seer among later speakers, suggests voting out Player 5 today.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a Villager. Trusts Player 5 as the Seer, accuses Players 6 and 8 of being werewolves. Believes Player 9 is the Witch, expects Player 8's werewolf teammate to pretend to be the Seer later. Follows Player 5's suggestion to vote out Player 6 this round.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be the Seer, declares Player 2 as bad identity. Accuses Players 2 and 5 of being werewolves, trusts Players 6 and 8 as good. Believes Player 9 is the Witch and Player 1 is the Guard. Suggests voting out Player 2 this round, asks the Witch to poison Player 5 at night, plans to check Player 4 tonight.\n\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be a Villager. Unable to define Player 7's identity who was eliminated at night. Trusts Player 3 as the Seer and Player 9 as the Witch, doesn't question Player 1's Guard identity. Believes Player 2 has a werewolf's perspective. Follows Seer Player 3's suggestion to vote out Player 2 this round.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Villager\n- **Player 7**: Werewolf\n- **Player 8**: Villager\n- **Player 9**: Witch\n- **Player 1**: Guard\n- **Player 2**: Werewolf\n- **Player 3**: Seer\n- **Player 4**: Villager\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 3.",

Player 5 giving Player 6 a bad identity while Player 6 didn't claim any special role doesn't align with typical werewolf behavior when receiving a bad identity. Werewolves usually claim to be the Seer or another special role to confuse the villagers and avoid being voted out. Based on Player 6's speech, we can deduce that Player 5 is likely pretending to be the Seer, and Player 6 is a villager.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, sides with the Seer in the later positions.\n\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 5 is pretending to be the Seer, considers Player 6 as good. Player 8's judgment aligns with mine. Knowing I'm good, Player 8 shares the same perspective, so Player 8 is likely good as well.\n\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the Witch, didn't save Player 7 who was attacked, thinks Player 5 could be the Seer or a werewolf, Player 6 could be a villager or werewolf, believes Player 8 is a villager.\n\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the Guard, didn't protect anyone last night, believes Player 9 is the real Witch, will protect Player 9 tonight, thinks Player 6 is a villager, votes for Player 5.

Player 2 siding with Player 5 without hearing Players 3 and 4's speeches seems more like a werewolf teammate of Player 5, rather than a villager's perspective. This suggests Player 5 is likely a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be the Seer, declares Player 2 as bad identity, believes Player 6 is good, Player 5 is pretending to be the Seer, thinks Player 8 is good, Player 9 is the Witch, Player 1 is the Guard.
