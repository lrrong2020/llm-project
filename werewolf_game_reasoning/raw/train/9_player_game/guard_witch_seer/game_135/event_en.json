I think Number 8 is a charging werewolf, paving the way for their fellow werewolf in a later position to pretend to be a seer.\n\nAmong the earlier speakers, only Number 9 claimed to be the witch. I believe the witch is a powerful role for the good team. It would be terrible if they were easily deceived by werewolves. I suggest that Number 9, as the witch, should think carefully and not be brainwashed by the little werewolf Number 8!\n\nI'm certain that one of Number 8's werewolf teammates in a later position will also pretend to be a seer. If I'm correct, I will surely be declared as a bad identity, but isn't my speech much better than Number 6's? I hope the good team won't be fooled by the werewolves.

My thought process for checking player 2 was to verify someone close to me, and indeed, player 2 turned out to be a werewolf. There are now two confirmed werewolves on the field: player 2, whom I identified, and player 5, who is pretending to be a seer. Player 5 claimed to have identified player 6 as a bad identity, but if player 6 were a werewolf, it's unlikely that their werewolf teammate, player 5, would have accused them. Moreover, player 6 hasn't claimed any special role, which doesn't align with typical werewolf behavior. Therefore, I believe player 6 is innocent. Player 8's logic aligns with mine, and they were the first to doubt player 5's claim of being the real Seer, so I trust that player 8 is also innocent. Player 9 has claimed to be the Witch, and their reported night information matches with player 1's Guard information, so I believe player 9 is the true Witch. Today, I urge all innocent players to vote with me to eliminate player 2. Tonight, the Witch should use her poison on player 5, and I will investigate player 4.",

Player 6 claims to be a villager. I believe player 6's speech is quite sincere, and 6 didn't claim a special role to gain the trust of good players, but only claimed to be a villager. Therefore, I tend to believe that 6 is a real villager. This means that player 5, who gave 6 a bad identity, is likely a werewolf trying to pretend to be a seer to eliminate the real seer.\n\n- **Player 3**: Gave player 2 a bad identity. Since player 2 directly believed that 5 was the seer without hearing the speeches of the later players, completely trusting 5 as the seer without listening to the other player claiming to be the seer, I believe that 2 is likely a werewolf rushing to support their werewolf teammate 5. Player 3 giving player 2 a bad identity means that 3 is likely the real seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 5**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 3.\n- **Player 2**: Is the bad identity identified by seer 3.\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 2.",

Player 5 didn't explain their thought process for checking player 6. I believe player 5 gave a bad identity to player 6 just to force player 6 to reveal their true identity. After receiving the bad identity from player 5, player 6 claimed to be a villager. I think if player 6 were a werewolf, they could have easily pretended to be a seer and given a bad identity to a player in a later position to force good players to reveal their identities, or claimed to be a guard to find the real guard's position. Instead, they claimed to be a villager, waiting for their werewolf teammate in a later position to pretend to be a seer and save player 6. Therefore, I believe player 6 is good. Consequently, player 5, who gave a bad identity to player 6, is likely pretending to be a seer.\n\n- **Player 3**: Gave a bad identity to player 2. Since player 2 directly attacked me (player 8) as a werewolf who's supporting a fake seer, I believe player 2 is likely a werewolf. Player 3 giving a bad identity to player 2 makes me inclined to believe that player 3 is the real seer.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on seer analysis:\n- **Player 5**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 3.\n- **Player 2**: Is the bad identity identified by seer player 3.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the real seer.\n\nBased on this, I decide to vote for player 2, who was identified as a bad identity by seer player 3.",
