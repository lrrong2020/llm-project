However, now that a player pretending to be a Seer has already created a confrontation with me, even this small amount of strength has vanished. Player 1, who spoke earlier, accepted Player 3's claim of a bad identity, establishing a \"reverse good identity\". From my perspective, I can confirm that Player 1 is a good player. Player 6 carefully analyzed Player 1's psychological motives and should side with me. I believe Player 6 is a player without night actions, working for the good team. We don't need to rush to identify the werewolves in the later positions today. After my verification tonight, I will reveal who the werewolves are. Two players have already left the game today. I urge all good players not to split their votes on the later positions. We must unite and vote together with me to eliminate Player 3, who is pretending to be a Seer!

I believe Player 2's attack on Player 1 as a werewolf, based on Player 1's trust in Player 2 as a good player, is a forceful accusation against Player 1. Since Player 1 spoke first, I'm more tolerant of the first speaker. I think Player 1's identity needs further consideration and isn't necessarily a werewolf. I believe Player 3 is pretending to be the Seer, giving Player 1 a bad identity based on Player 2's attack on Player 1's speech, following Player 2's logic to vote out Player 1, or Player 1 might be Player 3's werewolf teammate. Player 3 might have seen their werewolf teammate's weak speech and deliberately gave them a bad identity, so if their own pretense fails, they can elevate their werewolf teammate's status. Therefore, I think Player 1 could be either a werewolf or a villager, Player 2 could be either a werewolf or a villager, and Player 3 is most likely a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. I believe Player 7 is most likely the real Seer, and I suggest Player 7 check Player 2's identity tonight. I hope I haven't sided with the wrong player. This round, I will most likely vote for Player 3, and if I've sided incorrectly, I'm willing to be eliminated along with Player 3 tomorrow.",

Since Player 7 gave Player 8 a good identity instead of giving it to Player 6 (me) who clearly didn't side with Player 3 in the earlier positions, Player 7 doesn't seem like a werewolf trying to deceive good people by falsely declaring good identities. Player 7 appears more likely to be the real Seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 7 is the Seer, and therefore, I think Player 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n\n# In summary, I believe voting for Player 3 is the best choice this round.",

I continue to support No. 7 as the seer because if No. 3 were the seer and No. 7 were pretending to be the seer, given that No. 3 has identified No. 1 as a bad identity and No. 1 is No. 7's werewolf teammate, No. 7 would have to claim a bad identity for a player in a later position to gain credibility similar to No. 3's in order to potentially save their werewolf teammate No. 1 from being voted out. However, No. 7 claimed No. 8 as a good identity, which, in a situation where the villagers can't distinguish between the real and fake seers, could lead to voting out No. 1 who was identified as a bad identity by No. 3. This doesn't benefit the werewolf team at all. Therefore, I believe No. 7 is the real seer, No. 8 is a villager, No. 3 is pretending to be the seer, and No. 1 is likely a good player. Based on yesterday's voting pattern analysis, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 are on the same team, so No. 2 and No. 4 are also likely werewolves. Let's hear No. 7's seer report.

Apart from me, the remaining players alive are: No. 1, No. 2, No. 4, No. 7, and No. 8.\nAmong them, No. 7 is the Seer, No. 2 and No. 8 are confirmed as good identities by the Seer. Therefore, only No. 1 and No. 4 have unknown identities, so we should vote between No. 1 and No. 4 this round.\n\nSpeech and behavior analysis:\n- Player No. 1: This player was declared as a bad identity on the first day by No. 3, who pretended to be a Seer but was actually a werewolf. Theoretically, No. 1 is unlikely to be a werewolf, so there's a high possibility that No. 1 is a good player.\n- Player No. 4: This player claimed to be the Witch this round, but in the previous voting round, they voted for Player No. 1, who was declared as a bad identity by No. 3 (the fake Seer). I suspect the real Witch might be No. 5 or No. 9, who died on the first night. Therefore, there's a high probability that No. 4 is a werewolf.\nIn conclusion, between No. 1 and No. 4, No. 4 is more likely to be a werewolf.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I believe voting for Player No. 4 is the better choice this round.",
