How could this forced analysis make villagers think you have even a slight chance of being good? So I ask you, No. 5, why must it be werewolves who would vote you out? Villagers could vote you out too! In conclusion, I believe No. 5 is a werewolf trying to fill their speech but failing to do so effectively. No. 6 immediately attacked No. 5 afterwards, so I can consider No. 6 a villager who agrees with me. However, No. 7 said No. 6 seemed to be forcefully attacking No. 5 and believed No. 5 is a villager while No. 6 is a werewolf. This statement is extremely distorted from a logical perspective, and they even dare to side with the evil No. 5 werewolf! I'm directly accusing No. 5 of being a werewolf, No. 7 of being a werewolf protecting their teammate, and No. 8 of being a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Of course, these are just my current suspicions. If anyone in later positions claims to be the Guard, they must be a werewolf.

From this analysis, we can conclude that 5, 7, and 8 are likely on the same team. I agree with Number 9's logic that 5, 7, and 8 are three werewolves after receiving the bad identity. Number 1 claimed to be the guard, and I disagree with voting for 9 this round. I believe the suspected guard shouldn't be eliminated during the day, and we should vote between Number 8 and the player who also claims to be the seer in the later positions. Number 1's eagerness to eliminate 9 seems like werewolf behavior, so I think 9 is the real guard, while 1 and 8 are two werewolves. Therefore, there can be at most one werewolf between 5 and 7. This round, I will likely side with the seer in the later position and vote to eliminate Number 8 as a werewolf.",
