Therefore, I currently think Player 8 is more likely to be the Seer, while Player 9 seems to be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Two players died last night, indicating that the Witch has already used her poison. The Witch only has one antidote left, so it's highly possible that a werewolf might claim to be the Witch to find the real one.

Even after being declared as a bad identity by Number 8, who is pretending to be the seer, Number 9 still managed to withstand the pressure and identified Numbers 1, 3, and 8 as the three werewolves. I believe Number 9, the true seer, embodies the spirit of \"Not fearing to sacrifice oneself to maintain one's integrity in this world,\" which is worthy of all of us good people to learn from. Today, I will follow the lead of Number 9, the real seer, to vote for Number 3, the werewolf. I hope everyone can see the situation clearly, and we can work together to eliminate the evil werewolves.",
