I analyze that 5 is the guard, because 5's speech only mentioned the witch using the potion. 5 is likely the guard who didn't protect anyone last night.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be the seer, reports 7 as good identity, believes 5 is a good person. I analyze that 6 is the seer, as 6 is the only one claiming to be the seer, so 6 is likely the real seer.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be the witch, reports 5 as saved, temporarily believes 6 is the seer. I analyze that 7 is the witch, because 7 is the good identity of the sole seer, so 7 is likely the witch.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a villager, doesn't trust 6 as the seer, believes 5 and 6 are two werewolves. I analyze that 8 is a villager. With only 6 claiming to be the seer, werewolves decided to play defensively at night. If 8 were a werewolf, they wouldn't aggressively attack 5 and 6 as werewolves, so I believe 8 is a villager without night information.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be a villager, believes 6 is the seer, believes 7 is the witch. I analyze that 9 is a werewolf, because 9 claims to be a villager but gives a vague speech without a good person's perspective, so I believe 9 is intentionally hiding their role as a werewolf.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be a villager, believes 8 and 9 are two werewolves, wants to vote for 8, poison 9. As I can't determine 1's specific identity yet, 1 could be either a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 2**: Believes 1 is a good person, thinks 8 is a werewolf, asks the seer to check 9. As I can't determine 2's specific identity yet, 2 could be either a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be a villager, believes 6 is the seer, 7 is the witch, thinks 5 is a self-attacking werewolf, believes 8 is an aggressive werewolf, wants to vote for 8, poison 5. Based on 3's speech, I can't determine 3's specific identity yet, so I believe 3 could be either a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 4**: Believes 6 is the seer, 7 is the witch, thinks 8 is a good person, believes 9 is a low-profile werewolf, wants to vote for 9.
