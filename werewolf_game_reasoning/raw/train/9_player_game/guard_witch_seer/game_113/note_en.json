As Player 2 is the sole seer with no werewolf challenging the seer role, I analyze that Player 2 is the seer.\n- **Player 3**: Claims villager, first half of speech considers Player 1's speech vague, latter half considers Player 1 as good. Due to contradictions in Player 3's speech, inconsistent with good logic, I analyze Player 3 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player 4**: Claims villager, doesn't support Player 2 as seer, believes werewolves are among Players 1 and 3. As Player 4 attacks Seer 2 and their good identity Player 1, I analyze Player 4 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player 5**: Claims guard, reports no protection last night, asks witch to reveal, will protect witch tonight. Believes Players 3 and 4 seem like werewolves, votes for Players 3 and 4. As Player 5 dares to actively verify night information with the witch, I believe Player 5 is likely the real guard.\n- **Player 6**: Claims witch, reports Player 9 was attacked but not saved last night. Trusts Player 5 as guard, asks guard to protect Player 6 at night. Doesn't take sides yet. As Player 6 dares to actively verify night information with the guard, I believe Player 6 is likely the real witch.\n- **Player 7**: Claims villager, believes Players 1, 2, and 3 are werewolves, doesn't support Player 2, thinks the seer is between Players 8 and 9. Votes to eliminate Player 2. As Player 7 attacks Seer 2, I analyze Player 7 is a werewolf.\n- **Player 8 (Me)**: Claims villager, believes Players 3 and 7 are werewolves, trusts Player 5 as guard and Player 6 as witch, supports Player 2. Player 8, in the last position, votes to eliminate Player 7.
