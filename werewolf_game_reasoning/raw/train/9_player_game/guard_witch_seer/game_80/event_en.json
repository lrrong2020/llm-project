No. 2 gave a bad identity to a player in a later position, which has a 50% chance of hitting the real seer, so I think No. 2 could be either the seer or a werewolf. If No. 7 immediately claims to be the seer, I would most likely believe that No. 7 is the real seer, because if No. 7 were a werewolf receiving a bad identity claim in the last position, their werewolf teammates in earlier positions would definitely try to defend them.

            "context": "Good afternoon, everyone. I am your legendary Seer. Last night, I checked player 3 and found them to be a werewolf! My process for checking player 3 was based on my incredibly strong sixth sense, which led me to investigate the position where I felt a werewolf might be. Sure enough, I made a discovery and directly caught some wolf fur. Player 3 is confirmed as a bad identity! Player 2 gave me a bad identity, but it lacks any credibility. It's nothing more than a werewolf trying to throw a bad identity to a later position in an attempt to challenge the Seer. I can only say that this time, player 2, you've managed to challenge me!\n\nLast night, players 5 and 8 both died. I believe one of them was the Witch who was killed and then blindly poisoned the other player. If either player 5 or 8 was a werewolf, then this game will be much easier for us. However, if both players 5 and 8 were good people, then we have no room for error. We must eliminate a werewolf today to have any hope of victory!\n\nTo help my fellow good players distinguish who the real Seer is, let me point out some suspicious aspects of player 2's speech. Firstly, player 2 didn't mention who they were going to check at night. Two players had already spoken before you, player 2, and you remained indifferent? Secondly, you didn't arrange any tasks for the special role players. At the very least, you should have asked the Guard to protect you, or analyzed for the good team whether the Witch or Guard is still in play. I can only say that you, player 2, are completely irresponsible towards the good team. How could you possibly be holding the Seer card?\n\nFurthermore, player 3, as player 2's werewolf teammate, immediately stood up to frantically squeeze my living space. Player 3 said they hadn't heard player 7's speech yet, so they thought player 7 might be a villager or a werewolf. Why didn't you consider that I might be the Seer? Player 3, are you privy to hidden information, or have you already accepted that I'm the Seer? I can only say that the acting skills of players 2 and 3 are extremely poor, especially player 3, who has nearly made mistakes during their speech!\n\nGiven that I've already identified two werewolves, tonight I will check either player 1 or player 9. As for player 6, who recognized me as the Seer before I even spoke, I will definitely consider you a good person this round. Thank you for your trust!\n\nToday, let's all vote to eliminate player 3, the confirmed bad identity. Tonight, based on the voting results, I will check the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf!",

Player 7 suggested that Players 2 and 3 might be two werewolves, and also arranged the night's verification target and the work of special roles. Player 7's speech was relatively more comprehensive than Player 2's, which raised some concerns for me.\n\nAs a good person in this game, I currently don't have enough ability to discern the situation on the field.

Two players had already spoken before you, Player 2, yet you remained indifferent? Moreover, you didn't arrange tasks for the special roles. At the very least, you should have asked the Guard to protect you, or analyzed for the good team whether the Witch or Guard is still in play.\" Forcefully using this point to attack Player 2, from my perspective, Player 7 is a werewolf card desperately trying to discredit Player 2!\n- Player 7 also used the statement \"Player 3 said 'I can't hear Player 7's speech for now, Player 7 might be a villager or a werewolf,' so why don't you consider me as a Seer? Player 3, are you getting information you shouldn't have, or have you already assumed I'm the Seer?\" to forcefully paint Player 3 as a werewolf.\n- Personally, I don't think Player 3's speech indicates they are a werewolf. Player 3 pointed out that Player 2 might be a werewolf, showing a good team perspective, which proves Player 3 is on the good team. Based on this reasoning, I conclude that Player 7 is a werewolf.\nIn conclusion, I vote for Player 7.",
