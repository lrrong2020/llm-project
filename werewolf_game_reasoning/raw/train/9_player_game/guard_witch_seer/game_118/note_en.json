Player 2's speech is active and confident, like a villager's mindset. If player 2 were a werewolf, they could choose to pretend to be a seer or give a vague speech in the first position, so player 2 is likely a villager.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims witch, judges that player 8 died due to simultaneous guard and rescue, thinks player 2 leans towards good. Player 3 claiming witch and reporting player 8 died from simultaneous guard and rescue is very risky. If player 8 wasn't actually saved and guarded, the real guard would expose them, or the real witch would poison them. This doesn't align with werewolf's principle of maximizing benefits, so player 3 is likely the real witch.\n\n- **Player 4**: Claims villager, thinks player 2 is either villager or werewolf, believes player 3 is the witch, considers player 8's identity undefined. Player 4's speech is vague, and all special roles have been claimed, so player 4 could be either a villager or a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 5**: Claims seer, player 6 is good identity, thinks player 2 is a villager, believes player 3 is the witch.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claims villager, believes player 5 is the seer, supports player 5. Player 6 is verified as good identity by player 5 who claims to be the seer, and player 6 claims to be a villager, so player 6 must be a real villager.\n\n- **Player 7**: Believes player 3 is the real witch, thinks players 5 and 6 are werewolves, considers players 9 and 1 as good, thinks either player 2 or 4 is a werewolf, suspects player 8 might have been the seer, votes for player 5. Player 7 questions my identity as the seer, while I clearly know I'm the seer, so player 7 is likely a werewolf trying to undermine my seer status.\n\n- **Player 9**: Claims guard, believes player 3 is the witch, thinks player 5 is the seer, suspects player 7 is a werewolf, thinks player 1 is a werewolf. Player 9 believes player 3 is the real witch. If player 9 were a werewolf pretending to be the guard, then the deceased player 8 would be the real guard. Player 9 wouldn't need to confirm player 3's witch identity; it would be more beneficial for player 9 to deny guarding player 8 and falsely accuse player 3 of being a werewolf pretending to be the witch. Therefore, player 9 should be the real guard.\n\n- **Player 1**: Claims villager, believes player 5 is the seer, player 6 is good, thinks player 7 is good, suspects player 2 is a vague-speaking werewolf, votes for player 2, suggests the guard protect player 5.
