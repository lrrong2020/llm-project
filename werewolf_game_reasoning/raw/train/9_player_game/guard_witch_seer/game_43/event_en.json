If either the Guard or I are killed tonight, the Witch should use her healing potion. This speaking order is quite good because the good identity I've verified is in the last speaking position and can call for votes. Among the players speaking after me - Players 1, 2, and 4 - there must be a werewolf pretending to be a Seer, as Players 6 and 8 in the earlier speaking positions have already claimed to be villagers. Analyzing the current situation, among Players 5 to 9, Player 5 is verified as good, I'm the Seer, Player 7 is out and we don't know their identity, so either Player 6 or 8 could be a werewolf who hasn't claimed to be a Seer. Therefore, I might check Player 8's identity next, as their speech was too vague. This round, I'll vote for the werewolf pretending to be a Seer in the later speaking position.

Player 8's speech was too vague to determine their specific identity. Player 9 is pretending to be the Seer, so we should vote them out today. Regarding the statements from Players 1 and 2, I think Player 1 seems more like a good player, while Player 2 pointed out issues in Player 9's speech without directly siding with them, which seems like a werewolf leaving room for maneuver, possibly to switch sides if the real Seer speaks later.
