Since Number 5 is a good identity, they can help me lead the villagers in finding the werewolves. Last night was peaceful, thanks to the Witch and the Guard for protecting the village and maintaining peace. I'm not sure if the Witch still has the healing potion. If she does, the Witch can reveal herself today to coordinate with the Guard about last night's information, ensuring tonight will be peaceful and allowing me to report another round of identity checks. If the Witch announces today that she used the healing potion last night, then the Guard should protect me tonight, enabling me to report another round of checks. Today, I ask all good players to join me in voting out the werewolf in the later speaking positions who might pretend to be a Seer.

The unknown identities are Players 6, 7, and 8. All three of them claimed to be villagers. Player 7's stance is the same as Player 6's, but Player 7 attacked Player 6 as a possible werewolf. Therefore, I believe Players 6 and 7 are not on the same side, and one of them could be a werewolf. Player 8's individual speech didn't support Player 4, so Player 8 might be considering that Player 4 is pretending to be a Seer and giving a good identity to Player 5 in a later position, which means Player 5 is very likely to be Player 4's werewolf partner. However, Player 8 equated Player 5's identity with Players 6 and 7, so I believe Player 8's perspective is incorrect. I think Player 8 is the most likely werewolf among the earlier speakers. This round, I will vote for Player 8. I will listen to the speeches of Players 1, 2, and 3 in the later positions. If any of them seem very much like a werewolf, I will use my poison on them.

Players 6 and 7 choosing to directly side with player 4 seems a bit suspicious, like werewolves. Among the players who have spoken earlier, I think player 8 sounds the most like a villager.",

My werewolf teammates, Players 6 and 7, will follow my lead and vote to eliminate Player 8. I estimate that Player 8 will receive at least 5 votes today and might be eliminated. At this point, I can join the good players in voting for Player 8. If we successfully eliminate Player 8, who is a good player, it will create a greater advantage for our werewolf team. Therefore, I decide to vote for Player 8.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 8.",

Therefore, the unknown identities are only No. 6, 7, 8, 2, and 3, among which there are three werewolves and two villagers.\n\n# Identity analysis of suspected werewolves:\n- Among the front-seated players who have spoken - No. 6, 7, and 8, No. 6 supports No. 4, No. 7 also supports No. 4, but No. 7 attacked No. 6. Thus, I believe No. 6 and No. 7 are not on the same side. There might be one werewolf and one villager among them. Therefore, No. 8 is highly likely to be a werewolf. No. 8's speech didn't confirm whether No. 4 is the Seer, but No. 8 equated No. 5's identity with No. 6 and No. 7. Hence, I think No. 8 is very likely to be a werewolf with night actions.\n- Among the back-seated players No. 2 and No. 3, No. 2 expressed intention to vote for No. 8's elimination, but No. 3 believes No. 8 is good and wants to vote for No. 6. Given that I consider No. 6's identity unknown and No. 8 likely to be a werewolf, I think No. 3 is more likely to be a werewolf than No. 2. No. 3 is suspected to be a werewolf, while No. 2 is suspected to be a villager.\n\n# In conclusion, I suspect No. 8 and No. 3 to be werewolves. Since I have called for votes against No. 8 in my speech, I will prioritize voting for No. 8's elimination this round.",
