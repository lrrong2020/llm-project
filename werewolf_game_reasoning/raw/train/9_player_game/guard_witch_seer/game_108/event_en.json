If any players speaking after me make conflicting role claims, I'll reconsider the authenticity of these identities. For tonight's plan, I suggest the Guard protect the player they believe to be the Witch, and the Witch should use their healing potion. We must ensure a peaceful night on the second night, so that on the second day, everyone can hear new verification information. I haven't decided which player to verify yet, but I will choose from those whose speeches seem suspicious. I think Player 6, who spoke earlier, is trying to cause confusion.
