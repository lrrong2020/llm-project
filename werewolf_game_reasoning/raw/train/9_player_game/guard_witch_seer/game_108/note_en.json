Tentatively believes Player 3 is the Witch, will analyze further if anyone else claims to be the Witch later. My analysis: Player 4 claims to be the Guard early and dares to cross-check information with the Witch, likely to be the real Guard.\n\n- **Player 6**: First claims to be the Seer, reports Player 7 as a werewolf, then immediately claims to be a villager. My analysis: If Player 6 were a villager, there's no need to confuse the good team's perspective, therefore Player 6 is likely a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a villager.

States that the real Seer will come out later to protect Player 9. If no one claims to be the Seer later, then the eliminated Player 5 must have been the Seer, and will side with the later Seer.
