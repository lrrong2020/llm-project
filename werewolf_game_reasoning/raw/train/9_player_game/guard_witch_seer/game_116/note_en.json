I did not save Player 8.\n- Player 8 died.\n\n# Speech Summary and Analysis:\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the Guard, believes Player 8 is not the Witch. Player 1 is the only one claiming to be the Guard, eliminating the possibility of Player 8 being the Guard. Player 1 is likely the real Guard.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 1 is the real Guard, and Player 8's identity is undetermined. Player 2's speech is vague, their identity is unclear, could be a Werewolf or a Villager.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be good, believes Player 1 is the real Guard, thinks Player 2 is a Werewolf. Player 3 attacked Player 2, could be a Werewolf trying to deflect suspicion from Player 2, or a Villager who genuinely suspects Player 2.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be the Witch, didn't save Player 8, believes Player 1 is the Guard, Player 2 is a Villager, Player 3 is a Werewolf, and will poison Player 3 tonight.\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 1 is the Guard. Player 5's speech is brief, their identity is unclear, could be a Villager or a Werewolf.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 1 is the real Guard, Player 4 is the real Witch, Player 8 could be the Seer, a Villager, or a Werewolf. Thinks either Player 2 or 3 is a Werewolf and the other is a Villager. Suggests the Witch poison either Player 2 or 3. Player 6 is assigning many tasks to the special roles, could be a disruptive Werewolf or an enthusiastic Villager.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 6 is good, thinks either Player 2 or 3 is a Werewolf, Player 5 could be a Villager or Werewolf. Suggests voting out Player 2 and the Witch poisoning Player 3. Believes Player 9 is the Seer and suggests the Seer check Player 5. Player 7's behavior is very similar to Player 6, both are directing the special roles' night actions, so they are likely the same identity, either both Werewolves or both Villagers.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the Seer, Player 1 is good identity, believes Player 4 is the real Witch, Player 1 is the real Guard. Thinks Players 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 could be Villagers or Werewolves, Player 6 seems more like a Villager, Players 2 and 5 are Werewolves. Votes for Player 2 and will check Player 5 tonight. Player 9 is the only one claiming to be the Seer, eliminating the possibility of Player 8 being the Seer.

Player 6 likely a villager as there's no need to clear an eliminated player's identity if they were a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 7**: Claims villager, believes Player 9 is the Seer, thinks Player 3 is a werewolf, waiting for Seer's verification.

I think Player 8 could be a villager, seer, or werewolf.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 1 (me) is the guard. Thinks Player 8 could be a villager, seer, or werewolf. Player 2's speech is vague, I think Player 2 might be a villager with no night action or a werewolf giving an ambiguous speech.\n- **Player 3**: Didn't claim any role, thinks Player 2 is a werewolf protecting Player 1 (me). Since Player 3 is attacking Player 2, Player 3 could be a villager looking for werewolves or a werewolf trying to vote out Player 2 who is good.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be the witch, suspects Player 8 might be a werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the witch's potion. Believes Player 1 (me) is the guard. Thinks Player 2 is likely a villager, suspects Player 3 is a werewolf, and states they will use the poison on Player 3 tonight. Since Player 4 is the only one claiming to be the witch, they are likely the real witch.\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 1 is the guard and Player 4 is the witch. Due to Player 5's vague speech, I think they might be a villager with no night action or a werewolf giving an ambiguous speech.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 1 is the guard and Player 4 is the witch. Thinks Players 2 and 3 don't seem like two werewolves who have met, believes one of them is a werewolf and the other is a villager. I analyze that Player 6's opinion about Players 2 and 3 sounds like a good player looking for werewolves, so I think Player 6 is likely a villager.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a villager, thinks Player 6 is good. Believes there's likely one werewolf between Players 2 and 3. Suggests voting out Player 2 this round and recommends the witch poison Player 3 tonight. Player 7's view about Players 2 and 3 aligns with mine, so I think Player 7 is likely a villager.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the seer, says Player 1 (me) has a good identity, believes Player 1 (me) must be the guard. Thinks Player 4 is the witch, states they will check Player 5 tonight, and votes for Player 2 this round. Since Player 9 is the only one claiming to be the seer, they are likely the real seer.\n\n# Subjective identity judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Guard\n- **Player 2**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 3**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 4**: Witch\n- **Player 5**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Villager\n- **Player 7**: Villager\n- **Player 8**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 9**: Seer\n\n# My vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 2.",
