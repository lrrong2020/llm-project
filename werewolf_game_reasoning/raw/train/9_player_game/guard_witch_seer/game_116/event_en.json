Moreover, Player 2's speech directly assumed that Player 1 (me) is the Guard, without any suspicion that I could be a werewolf pretending to be the Guard. Therefore, I believe Player 2 might already know Player 1's (my) identity is good, suggesting Player 2 is likely a werewolf with night actions.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 2.",

Addressing Player 9, the Seer: If you think I'm a werewolf, you can verify me tonight, but you absolutely cannot vote me out this round. You believe Player 2 is a werewolf, and I was the first one to suggest that yesterday! How could you possibly vote me out this round if you think Player 2 is a werewolf? Moreover, from last round's discussion, we know that Player 6 asked the Witch to poison Player 3, and Player 7 did the same. So, I don't align with Players 6 and 7. If I were a werewolf, who could be my teammate? Player 2, whom I voted out on the first day? Or Player 8, who was eliminated on the first night? Or Players 6 and 7, who suggested the Witch poison me? I can't be teammates with anyone, so voting me out is absurd! I believe the werewolf is either Player 6 or 7. Comparing their speeches, Player 7 hasn't said anything useful, yet somehow you all - Seer, Witch, and Guard - think they're good? This game is too difficult. I think Player 7 is a passive werewolf, and I'll vote for them this round. Witch, I've lost hope in you as well. If the game doesn't end after voting out Player 7, we'll vote for Player 6 tomorrow. This Witch surely can't identify the werewolves correctly, so there's no point in relying on them.",

Since Number 9 clearly instructed the Guard to protect Number 4 during their speech, killing the Witch wouldn't have been successful. Today, both Number 6 and Number 7's speeches sound like good people. I reasonably suspect that the eliminated Number 8 and Number 2 were both werewolves, and the werewolf team has given up resistance. The good side is currently in a commanding lead, so I chose not to use my poison last night, wanting to give Number 3 another chance to defend themselves today.

Therefore, I believe Player 6 is likely a good person.\n- **Player 7**: In the last round, Player 7's opinion that either Player 2 or 3 is a werewolf aligns with my view. Thus, I believe Player 7 is likely a good person.\n- **Player 3**: I think if Player 3 were a good person, they should have tried to gain trust from other good people, rather than attacking the Witch who has already revealed their identity. Therefore, I believe Player 3's speech sounds like a werewolf.\n- In conclusion, I think Players 6 and 7 are good people, while I believe Player 3 is a werewolf.\n\n# Based on the above, I decide to vote for Player 3.",
