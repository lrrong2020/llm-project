Because Player 6's speech was too vague, I suspect they might be a werewolf trying to lay low, so I will verify Player 6's identity.\n**Next day's speech strategy**:\n- Inform all the good players about the night's verification result, and lead them to vote out the werewolf.",
                    "notes": "# Night Information:\n- Seer, checked player 5 and found them to be a good identity.\n- Peaceful night, no one died.\n\n# Speech Summary and Analysis:\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be a villager, gives a vague speech. Player 9's speech is too brief for me to accurately define their identity. I think 9 might be a villager without information or a werewolf giving a vague speech.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the witch, reports player 7 as their saved target. States they will closely observe player 7's speech this round, and thinks player 9 might be a villager with no night action or a werewolf giving a vague speech. Since only player 1 claims to be the witch and no other player challenges this claim, player 1 is likely the real witch.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a villager, gives a vague speech. As the third speaker, player 2 didn't analyze the identities of other players who have already spoken, but chose to give a vague speech like player 9. Therefore, I think player 2 might be a werewolf who doesn't dare to analyze the situation and chooses to give a vague speech.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be a villager, states they can't determine if player 9 is good, believes player 1 is the real witch, and thinks player 2 might be a werewolf giving a vague speech. Player 3's opinion about player 2 being a werewolf aligns with mine, so I think player 3 is likely a villager.\n- **Player 4**: I claim to be the seer and report player 5 as a good identity. I think players 3 and 9 might be villagers or werewolves. I believe player 2 might be a werewolf who doesn't dare to analyze the situation.\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be the guard, believes player 1 is the witch. Thinks player 4 (me) is the seer, and is certain that player 2 is a werewolf. States they will follow player 4 (me) in voting to eliminate player 2 this round. Since player 5 is my good identity, player 5 is indeed the guard.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be a villager, believes player 1 is the witch. Thinks player 2 is a werewolf giving a vague speech, sides with player 4 (me) this round, and votes for player 2. Due to player 6's vague speech, I think they might be a villager with no night action or a werewolf giving a vague speech.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a villager, thinks player 6 is a werewolf. Believes player 9 might be player 6's werewolf teammate, thinks player 4 (me) is the seer, and player 5 is the guard. States they will vote for player 6, suggests the witch poison player 9, and recommends that player 4 (me) check player 3 or 8. Since player 7 didn't follow player 4 (me) in voting for player 2, I think player 7 might be protecting their werewolf teammate, player 2.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a villager, believes player 4 (me) is the seer, player 5 is the guard, and player 1 is the witch. States they will follow player 4 (me) and player 5 in voting for player 2. Thinks player 6 might be a werewolf giving a vague speech. I think player 8 has reasonable analysis of all players' identities, so they seem like a villager seriously analyzing the situation.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Witch\n- **Player 2**: Werewolf\n- **Player 3**: Villager\n- **Player 4**: Seer\n- **Player 5**: Guard\n- **Player 6**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 7**: Werewolf\n- **Player 8**: Villager\n- **Player 9**: Villager or Werewolf\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for player 2.",
