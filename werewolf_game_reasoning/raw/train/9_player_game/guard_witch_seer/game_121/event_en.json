I think 9 might be a villager without night information or a werewolf trying to get by with a vague speech.\n\nPlayer 1 claimed to be the Witch. Since a werewolf pretending to be the Witch would certainly be poisoned by the real Witch, if 1 were a werewolf, claiming to be the Witch would be like walking into a trap. So, for now, I don't doubt 1's identity as the Witch.\n\nPlayer 2's speech was almost identical to 9's. As the third speaker, 2 didn't analyze the identities of 1 and 9. I think 2 might be a werewolf who chose to give a vague speech because they're afraid to analyze the situation.\n\nPlayer 3's speech was standard, but at least they commented on the speeches of the players before them. I think 3 could be either a villager or a werewolf.\n\nTo all the good players: if there's a werewolf in the later positions pretending to be a Seer, then this round, please vote with me for that fake Seer.

Werewolves wouldn't pretend to be the witch in the second speaking position, as the real witch would certainly use her poison on them at night, making such a claim pointless. Based on No. 2's speech, I think No. 2 is just a werewolf trying to lay low. I side with No. 4 as the seer, and I vote for No. 2 this round.",

I think Number 6's speech sounds like a werewolf because the earlier speakers, Numbers 2 and 9, both gave vague speeches, but Number 6 directly accused Number 2 of being a werewolf without commenting on Number 9's speech at all. This makes me suspect that Number 9 might be Number 6's werewolf partner, which is why Number 6 didn't comment on Number 9's speech and immediately called for a vote against Number 2. Number 4 claimed to be the seer and gave a good identity to Number 5, who speaks after him. Number 4 isn't afraid of the later speakers opposing him during the police chief election, so I believe Number 4's verification is very credible, and I trust that Number 4 is the seer. If Number 8, who speaks after me, claims to be the seer, I will vote for Number 8 today, and suggest the witch poison Number 6, while the seer should verify Number 9. If Number 8 doesn't claim to be the seer, then Number 4 will be the unopposed seer, and I will vote for Number 6 today, suggest the witch poison Number 9, and Number 4 as the seer can verify either Number 3 or Number 8 tonight.",

However, I ask seer number 4 to consider: is it possible that number 2 is actually a true villager, and numbers 3 and 6 are werewolves trying to eliminate a good player? Especially player number 6, who attacked player number 2 as if they were a passive werewolf, but in my view, number 6's speech could also be that of a passive werewolf.

They might assume that Player 7 (a werewolf) is trying to protect Player 2 (another werewolf) by voting for an innocent player in a later position. This strategy could enhance Player 6's credibility as an innocent, allowing them to safely remain in the game. Considering all factors, voting for my werewolf teammate Player 6 yields the most benefits. Therefore, I will vote for Player 6 this round.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 6.",

Last night, player 1, who is the witch, was killed, and player 1 chose to poison player 7. Since players 2 and 7 both voted for player 6 (the werewolf) yesterday, I analyze that there are two possible scenarios for this voting result. The first scenario is that both players 2 and 7 are good people, and they both voted for player 6, the werewolf. The second scenario is that both players 2 and 7 are werewolves, deliberately voting for their werewolf teammate, player 6, in an attempt to enhance player 6's credibility. Tonight, I will check player 9's identity. For this round, I call for a vote to eliminate player 6, the werewolf. Please make sure not to split the votes.",
