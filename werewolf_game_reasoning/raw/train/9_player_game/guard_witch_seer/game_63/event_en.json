Witch, please save us from any deaths tonight. Tomorrow, we'll vote out player 5, and after that, the remaining villagers just need to work together to find the last werewolf to win!

The day after tomorrow, you might be able to get a villager voted out, so you still have a chance to win. I'm rooting for you~\n\nTo Witch 2, tonight you should just calmly save someone from a later position. Don't feel pressured, because if I were a werewolf, I wouldn't need to reveal myself like this. You don't need to use your poison tonight. Wait until tomorrow when we vote out player 5, then you can choose to poison who you think is the last werewolf that night.\n\nTo Guard 6, after protecting the Witch tonight, on the following night, you can choose to not guard anyone or guard yourself. It's up to you how you want to play mind games with the werewolves.\n\nTo Werewolf 5, let's make a gentleman's agreement. I won't attack you this round, so don't attack me tomorrow. Please cooperate and accept your elimination tomorrow, letting the last werewolf try their best on their own. I'm speaking this way because I don't want to put too much pressure on the villagers, while also giving the werewolves a slim chance.\n\nAfter we vote out player 5 tomorrow, the Witch can use her poison at night, and the Guard can still protect themselves. The villagers still have a very high chance of winning.\n\nTo summarize, I am the Seer. I believe players 5 and 8 are werewolves, player 2 is the Witch, player 6 is the Guard. I'm not making judgments on the other players' identities yet. For this round, I suggest voting for player 9.",

I believe the greatest distance is between me and the werewolves, so I checked player 9, who is farthest from me, and indeed they turned out to be a werewolf! The situation on the field is now very clear. Players 7 and 9 are two werewolves who have met. The werewolves must have discussed their strategy during the night, letting player 7 give player 9 a good identity, while player 9 betrays this and claims to be the Seer to solidify their \"Seer\" identity. Although this sacrifices their werewolf teammate player 7, it would make the good guys believe that player 9 is the real Seer! I must say to the werewolf team, your strategy is brilliant, truly brilliant. I applaud you werewolves! As for player 5, whether you're a foolish villager who jumped out to cause trouble, that's not something we need to analyze today. Just wait for me to check you tonight. My focus is only on players 7 and 9, these two werewolf cards playing off each other's identities. Today, please don't split the votes. Let's all vote to eliminate player 9, the werewolf I identified. Tonight, I'll check player 5, and this way, the situation will become clear! I am your ultimate Seer. If everyone feels confused and unable to distinguish the real Seer, I'm willing to be poisoned. Exchanging my life for two definite werewolves and one highly probable werewolf, I consider this a heroic act!",

This led to Player 7 giving a good identity to Player 9, the real Seer.\n\nLogical relationship analysis:\n- Player 7 believes Player 5 is the real Seer, so they gave a good identity to Player 9 in a later position. Players 7 and 9 are not on the same team.\n- Player 9 verified Player 8 as a bad identity, summarized the votes to vote for themselves, then aimed to eliminate the werewolf team with a one-for-two benefit.\n- Player 1 verified Player 9 as a bad identity.

The speaking order is 5, 7, 9, and 1.\n- **Player 5**: Declares player 8 as a bad identity.\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 9 as a good identity.\n- **Player 9**: Declares player 8 as a bad identity.\n- **Player 1**: Declares player 9 as a bad identity.\n\n# Possibility of Alliances:\n- Player 7 declares player 9 as a good identity, but 9 contradicts this by claiming to be a seer. This raises 9's credibility, so I believe there might be an alliance between 7 and 9.\n- Player 5 and player 9 both declare player 8 as a bad identity. Since 9's speech clearly aims to eliminate both 5 and 8, I don't think 5 and 9 are allied.\n- Player 1 declares player 9 as a bad identity, while 9 declares 8 as bad. 1's action undoubtedly lowers 9's credibility as a seer, so I don't think 1 and 9 are allied.\nTherefore, I judge that the possibility of alliances between 1 and 9, or 5 and 9, is low. I believe there's an alliance between 7 and 9.\n\n# Contradicting Good Identity:\n- Player 7 declared player 9 as a good identity. However, 9 contradicted this by claiming to be a seer. In a seer confrontation, one must be the true seer. Before considering 9 as a werewolf, we need to consider that 7, who declared 9 as good, might be a werewolf. So, from a logical priority analysis, 7 can only be a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 7.",

So, logically, player 7 can only be a werewolf.\n- However, player 9, while countering player 7, didn't attack player 7, essentially acknowledging player 7's seer identity. If players 7 and 9 were both werewolves, and one of the other two seer-claiming players (1 or 5) was also a werewolf, then all three werewolves would be exposed, which benefits the werewolf team in no way. So the logic of players 7 and 9 being both werewolves doesn't hold. In my view, player 7 is likely the real seer, and player 9 is likely truly a good identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the real seer.\n\n# Based on the seer's judgment, here's the identity analysis of other players:\n- **Player 5**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n- **Player 1**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n- **Player 9**: A good player verified by player 7.\n- Because the seer I believe in, player 7, votes for player 5.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 5.",

Player 7's speech not only failed to contribute anything to the good team but also added unnecessary considerations for the good players. I voted for myself yesterday to prove my identity as the seer. I am a consistent seer in words and actions! However, the werewolves are not united! Players 5 and 1 actually split their votes! It's a pity for the werewolves that they didn't manage to vote me out. But I am a merciful seer, so I've decided to give you werewolves a small chance. Today, I will still vote for myself, and I'm calling on all the good players to vote me out today! The witch should poison player 5 tonight, and tomorrow the good players can choose whether to vote for player 1 or not. To player 1, you don't need to say much. Just think carefully about whether to kill the guard or the witch tonight, and then make a good speech tomorrow to try to win the trust of the good players. Good luck~ I'm calling on all the good players here: although I'm the seer, I'm asking you to vote me out! This is not me being irresponsible. On the contrary, it's precisely because I'm the seer that I want the good team to win. I don't want the good players to have too many unnecessary considerations. Moreover, I've already identified all the werewolves, so I'm making the decision for the good players. Vote me out today! The witch should poison player 5, and tomorrow if the good players believe I'm the seer, vote for player 1, and the good team will achieve a complete victory! If the good players don't believe I'm the seer, then go find out who the last werewolf is! To summarize: I am the seer, I believe players 1, 5, and 8 are werewolves, player 2 is the witch, player 6 is the guard, and players 3, 4, and 7 are villagers. This round, I'm calling for votes on player 9!",

Thus, all three werewolves have been identified: Players 1, 5, and 8.\n\n- Last night, I verified Player 1 as a werewolf, so I should logically vote for Player 1. However, I'm concerned that the villagers might not choose the correct side. Therefore, in my speech, I suggest that I can be voted out this round, as long as the Witch uses her poison to eliminate Player 5 tonight. This is equivalent to exchanging myself for a werewolf, which won't hinder the villagers' progress towards victory and will also gain the approval of uninformed villagers. Hence, I choose to \"cooperate in being eliminated\" today.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe voting for Player 9 is the better choice this round.",

The speaking order is No.9, then No.1.\n- **Player No.9**: Gave a bad identity to player No.1.\n- **Player No.1**: Gave a bad identity to player No.5.\n- Since No.5 claimed to be the seer on the first day and a villager on the second day, I believe a villager would definitely not pretend to be a seer on the first day to cause trouble, so No.5 must be a werewolf.\n- Combining the alliance relationship analysis, I think No.1, who gave a bad identity to the werewolf No.5, is likely to be the real seer.\nTherefore, I judge that No.1 is probably the seer.\n# Werewolf possibility analysis:\n- No.5's behavior of claiming to be the seer on the first day is typical werewolf behavior, so No.5 must be a werewolf.\n- No.1, who gave a bad identity to No.5, is likely the seer, but we can't rule out the possibility of them being a werewolf.\n- No.9, who is competing with No.1 for the seer role, is likely a werewolf, but we can't rule out the possibility of them being the real seer.\nThus, the order of werewolf possibility is: No.5 > No.9 > No.1\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player No.5.",

I believe if 5 were a werewolf, there would be no need for such a pretentious retraction, so 5 is likely a genuine villager.\n- Player 1 declared player 5 as a bad identity. Since I think 5 is probably a villager, 1 is likely a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n- Based on my logic from yesterday that players 7 and 9 are both good people, I believe 9 is most likely the real seer. 9 declared player 1 as a bad identity, which aligns with my suspicion.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for player 1.",
