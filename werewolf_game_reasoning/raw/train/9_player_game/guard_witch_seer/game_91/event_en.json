I think 7 is the real Guard because there's no reason for a werewolf to put themselves in the spotlight from such an advantageous speaking position, as it wouldn't benefit the werewolf team at all. Player 9 claimed to be the Seer. I can only say that 9's speech and conviction were average, with no standout points or particularly impressive aspects. But you, Player 1, are very strange. You blindly sided with 9. May I ask, what's your reason for supporting 9? You didn't give any explanation for your support, so I can only assume that you, Player 1, are a werewolf charging forward to support 9! Player 2's viewpoint is similar to mine, so I believe 2 is a good person. I don't think 9 is the legendary Seer I'm looking for, so I'm directly siding with the Seer in the later speaking positions!",

Player 3 supports Player 4's fake seer claim and didn't find any issues with Player 9's speech, instead analyzing Player 9 as a werewolf based on Player 1's support. So I want to ask Player 3, in your eyes, isn't it possible that Player 1 is a werewolf deliberately choosing to support the opposing seer to frame the real seer? To distinguish the real seer, we should listen to the independent speeches of the players claiming to be the seer, not rely on the statements of players in later positions! I believe Player 3 is a werewolf supporting the fake seer. I suggest Seer 9 verify Player 3's identity tonight. This round, I will definitely bring Player 4, the werewolf, to justice!",

Second, player 2 accused players 1 and 9 of being a werewolf pair yesterday, claiming that player 1 was my aggressive teammate. However, player 1's speech indicated they would side with me. If player 1 were a werewolf, they could only be forcibly siding with me as a reverse aggressive werewolf, attempting to get me, the real Seer, voted out. Therefore, I chose to check player 2 last night, and player 2 indeed turned out to be a werewolf.\n\nFurthermore, player 4's speech yesterday can be summarized as \"I gave player 5 a bad identity because player 9 didn't explain why they checked player 4 and gave them a bad identity, so player 9 must be pretending to be the Seer.\" Player 4's speech lacked logical reasoning throughout, clearly indicating a werewolf card that immediately pretended to be the Seer after being identified as a werewolf.\n\nPlayers 2 and 4 are both werewolves, and they voted together in the previous round. I believe one of players 6 and 8 is a werewolf, and the other is the Witch. Players 1, 3, and 5 are all siding with me, so player 2 should be the last surviving werewolf on the field.

The problem is, you, Player 4, didn't explain your thought process of verifying Player 5 either. So how can you use this point to attack Player 9? You, Player 4, are completely forcing an attack on Player 9! Moreover, Player 5's self-defense yesterday was very convincing to me. Player 5 thought that Player 1 was deliberately making mistakes during the speech to undermine Player 9 as the seer, which is indeed a point I hadn't considered! Although Player 5 accused me of being a werewolf yesterday, I still think Player 5 is very thoughtful and definitely a good person! As for Player 1, I think you're either a werewolf or a villager, and at worst, I'll join you on the PK stage tomorrow!
