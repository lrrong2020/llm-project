Player 4's opening speech was too brief, so I can't determine their identity. Last night, players 1 and 5 both died. I believe one of them was killed by the werewolves, and the Witch, left with no choice, had to poison the other player! I hope a werewolf has already been eliminated; otherwise, if we vote incorrectly today, the good team might collapse! Addressing player 8, as my good identity, I allow you to speak freely. Even if someone is to be eliminated today, I'll take your place! Today, let's unanimously vote out the werewolf in the later positions who's pretending to be a Seer.

So 6 and 7 can't both be werewolves, and since ordinary villagers wouldn't pretend to be seers to disrupt the situation, one of them must be the real seer.\n- Good players wouldn't pretend to be seers to disrupt the situation, so regardless of whether 6 or 7 is the real seer, player 9 pretending to be a seer must be a werewolf.\n- Based on the logic that 9 is a werewolf, we can deduce: since 9 declared 7 as bad identity, 9 and 7 are not on the same side.\n- Player 6 votes for players who later claimed to be seers, while 9 declared 7 as bad identity, so 6 and 9 are likely to be a pair of werewolves.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgment on this.\n\n# Identity Assessment of Other Players Based on the Seer:\n- **Player 6**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n- **Player 8**: Player 7's bad identity.\n- **Player 9**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 9>6=8\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 9.",

If Number 9 hadn't claimed to be the Seer, both Number 6 and Number 8 would have been exposed as werewolves. Number 9 chose to claim the Seer role to confuse the villagers' perspective and declared that I have a bad identity. Players who support me, please vote for Number 9 this round!",

At the same time, Player 8, as Player 6's good identity, also voted for Player 7. Therefore, Player 6 should have followed their good identity, Player 8, and voted for Player 7. But Player 6 didn't vote for Player 7, instead voting for me, Player 9. So we can conclude that Players 6 and 7 are both werewolves. As for Player 3 saying that I, Player 9, didn't analyze the possibility of Players 6 and 8 being a werewolf pair in my speech, I can only say please don't be so ridiculous, and check if I mentioned this situation in my speech. Moreover, Player 3, in the last speaking position, voted for me, Player 9, which seems like they're helping Player 6, the werewolf, to charge forward. Therefore, I believe the three werewolves in this game are Players 3, 6, and 7, while the remaining Players 2, 4, and 8 are all good people. So I hope Player 2 can reconsider.

So I ask No. 2, if you think No. 9 is a werewolf, who would be their werewolf partner? Firstly, No. 9 declared No. 7 as a bad identity and voted for No. 7 in both rounds, proving that No. 9 and No. 7 can't be werewolves together. Secondly, if No. 6 and No. 9 were both werewolves, how do you explain No. 6 voting for No. 9 in both rounds? No. 6 had every reason to vote for No. 7! So No. 9 has no alliance with No. 6 or No. 7, which leaves only one possibility: No. 6 and No. 7 are the two werewolves. No. 2 has already been eliminated, so we won't define their identity now.

Now, I'm addressing No. 3, No. 4, and No. 8. Yesterday, my reason for initially voting for No. 9 was simple. Although both No. 7 and No. 9 were definite werewolves, to avoid split voting, I had to follow No. 3's lead and vote for No. 9 first. Before yesterday's vote, I had no interest in your identity, No. 3. In my eyes, as long as we could vote out a werewolf, that was all that mattered! No. 9 tried to attack me for not voting for No. 7 first, which only reveals their malicious intent to protect the fake seer. I don't care about the order in which No. 9 and No. 7 are eliminated; I just wanted to avoid split voting and ensure a werewolf was voted out, that's why I voted for No. 9 first! Today, let's unanimously vote out No. 9, who is pretending to be a seer. I bet that between No. 1 and No. 5, one is a werewolf and the other is the witch. I hope No. 3 and No. 4 won't remain misguided. I am your true seer! How about this: even if No. 3 and No. 4 don't believe me, you should trust my good identity, No. 8. So, please listen to No. 8's vote. If No. 8 betrays me and votes for me, I'm willing to vote for myself to prove my innocence!",

In the previous round, I clearly stated in my speech that I wanted to vote for player 7 to be eliminated, but player 6 didn't vote with me in both rounds. I believe a real seer wouldn't fail to vote with their confirmed good identity. Therefore, I think players 6 and 7 are likely to have a shared relationship, possibly being two werewolf cards.\n\n- **Player 9**: On the first day, they gave player 7 a bad identity, and on the second day, they gave player 2 a good identity. If players 6 and 7 were a seer and a werewolf, then player 9, speaking in a later position, would have no need to pretend to be a seer, as this would expose their identity. Therefore, I believe player 9 is the real seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 9 is the real seer, and I decide to vote for player 6.",
