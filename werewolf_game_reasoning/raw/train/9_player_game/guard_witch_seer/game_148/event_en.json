No. 5 dares to cross-check the night information with the guard, so I believe No. 5 is the real witch. Therefore, No. 4, who gave a bad identity to No. 5, must be a werewolf pretending to be the seer, and No. 7, who is competing with No. 5 for the witch role, must also be a werewolf pretending to be the witch.

I believe player 4 doesn't have the mindset of a seer.\n- **Player 2**: Gave player 4 a bad identity.

Currently, only player 1 claims to be the guard, so player 1 is likely the true guard. Players 5 and 7 both claim to be the witch, with player 5 claiming first. Player 5 stated they didn't save player 6, who was killed last night. When player 5 spoke, no guard had yet revealed last night's protection information. I believe if player 5 were a werewolf pretending to be the witch, they wouldn't know the true reason for player 6's death. Player 5 dared to claim the witch role, and their report of player 6's death reason matches the information given by player 1 (the guard), so I believe player 5 is the true witch. Since I believe player 5 is the true witch, player 4, who declared player 5 as a bad identity, must be a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\n- **Player 2**: Player 2 claims to be a seer, declaring player 4 as a bad identity. Based on my belief that player 4 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, I think player 2, who is competing with player 4 for the seer role, is the true seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 2 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's assessment:\n- **Player 4**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, competing with player 2.\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 4.",
