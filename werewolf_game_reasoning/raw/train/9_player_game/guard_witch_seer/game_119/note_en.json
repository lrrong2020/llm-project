Hopes the Witch will reveal if they used the potion last night. I think Player 5 seems like a werewolf looking for the Witch.\n- **Player 6**: I'm a villager. I believe if the Witch didn't use the potion last night, they should reveal their identity so the Guard can protect them.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a villager, thinks Player 5 shouldn't want the Witch to reveal if they're good. Believes Player 5 seems like a werewolf looking for the Witch. Since Player 7 is Player 8's good identity, Player 7 is a villager.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be the Seer, declares Player 7 as good identity, states they'll check Player 5 tonight. Since Player 8 is the only one claiming to be the Seer, excluding the low probability of Player 9 being the Seer killed on the first night, Player 8 is likely the real Seer.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be a villager, believes there must be a werewolf among Players 5, 6, and 7. Thinks Player 7 seems like a werewolf. Believes Player 8 giving Player 7 a good identity is a werewolf validating another werewolf. Since Player 1 is attacking Player 8, the only claimed Seer, Player 1 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Witch, states they didn't use the potion last night. Believes Player 8 is the Seer, Player 7 is good, and Player 1 is likely a werewolf. I analyze that if Player 2 were a werewolf, they probably wouldn't risk pretending to be the Witch and getting poisoned. Since Player 2 didn't call for votes this round, I think if they were a werewolf, they would likely vote for a good player, so Player 2 is probably the real Witch.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be the Guard, thinks Player 9 might be good or a self-killing werewolf. Can't trust Player 8 as the Seer, believes Player 2 is the Witch. Thinks at least two werewolves are among Players 1, 5, and 6. States they'll protect Player 2 (Witch) tonight. I analyze that Player 3's statement about at least two werewolves among Players 1, 5, and 6 sounds like a werewolf trying to vote out good players, but since no one else claimed to be the Guard this round, I think Player 3 might be the Guard or a werewolf.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 8 is the Seer and Player 7 is a villager. Trusts Player 2 as the Witch and Player 3 as the Guard. Thinks Player 5's speech sounds like a werewolf trying to find the Witch, voting for Player 5 this round. Player 4's view on Player 5 aligns with mine, so I think Player 4 is likely a villager.\n\n# Subjective identity judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Werewolf\n- **Player 2**: Witch\n- **Player 3**: Guard or Werewolf\n- **Player 4**: Villager\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Villager\n- **Player 7**: Villager\n- **Player 8**: Seer\n- **Player 9**: Guard or Werewolf\n\n# My vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 5.",
