When the sun rose this morning, I realized it was a peaceful night. I can't help but sincerely thank the Witch for using her potion to save the eliminated player. Witch, you're amazing! You're the guardian angel of our village!\n\nLet me comment on the players in the earlier positions: Number 9, in the first position, claimed to be the Seer and gave a bad identity to Number 8. Their speech was only 54 words, quite brief, but without any obvious mistakes. Number 1 said that Number 9's speech was concise, powerful, and logically clear. I think this might be overpraising Number 9, as they simply reported their verification without providing any valuable logic. If Number 9 is a werewolf, I suspect Number 1 is likely their teammate, acting as a charge wolf to support them.\n\nNumber 2's analysis of Numbers 9 and 1 aligns with mine, so I tentatively believe Number 2 is a good person. If Number 8 in the later position chooses to immediately claim to be the Seer, I will likely believe that Number 9 is the real Seer. However, if another player in a later position also claims to be the Seer, competing with Number 9, then I'll need to compare the speeches of both self-proclaimed Seers to decide which side to support.",

Four people before me have already claimed to be villagers, and with me, that makes five. So, is this game eight good guys against one werewolf? Haha, that's ridiculous! Therefore, I believe there must be a werewolf among the players in the earlier positions who claimed to be villagers! I trust that player 9 is the real seer, and we should vote to eliminate player 8, who is a werewolf!",

In the current situation, I wish I were the Seer, but my role card is just a Guard! I don't know who the Seer is or why they didn't reveal their identity on the first day. Now the Witch has used the healing potion to save Player 1, a werewolf, and Player 9 wants to vote me, Player 8 the Guard, out. Who will protect you then? I'm addressing Player 4, the Witch: if the werewolf team rushes to vote me out today, I hope you'll poison Player 9, the fake Seer, after I'm eliminated. You've already saved Player 1, the self-injured werewolf, so I hope you'll reconsider. If Player 9 is eliminated today, Witch, you can decide whether to poison Player 1 or not; I won't make that decision for you. I hope the good team can believe that I'm the Guard.

This clearly shows you're hiding your identity and trying to deflect votes onto innocent players, so you must be the werewolf! Of course, I haven't heard No. 2's speech yet.

The situation on the table is now quite clear: No. 5 and No. 8, both werewolves, have been eliminated. The remaining werewolf is hiding among players 1, 2, 6, and 7! Player 1 is the Witch's saved target, so even if they're a self-stabbing werewolf, we can leave the analysis for tomorrow. Player 2's speech was strange; they assumed that No. 7 claimed to be the Guard last round because No. 7 suggested the Seer check among the five players who claimed to be villagers, and since No. 4 is the Witch, No. 7 must be the Guard. Can you really accept No. 7's Guard identity just because they suggested the Seer check among the five front-row players who claimed to be villagers? If No. 7 were a werewolf, couldn't they say the same thing to avoid becoming the focus? I think your perspective, No. 2, is too advanced and seems to be deliberately trying to gain No. 7's trust and rally the good guys to vote against other innocent players! Player 6 thinks I'm good this round, so I'll tentatively mark you as good too. In Player 7's speech this round, I don't hear many slip-ups, and I think their analysis of the werewolf positions aligns with my view, so No. 7 can also be considered good today. Let's hear No. 4 Witch's vote first, but I believe No. 2 is the last werewolf!",
