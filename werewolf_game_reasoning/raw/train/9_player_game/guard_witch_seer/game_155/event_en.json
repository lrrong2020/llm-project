It's understandable that Player 6 gave silver water to their werewolf teammate to establish their identity. However, Player 7 didn't pretend to be a seer, which means another werewolf would have to claim to be a seer later. This would expose all three werewolves, which seems too bold. If Player 9 is a werewolf who gave Player 7 a bad identity, it could only be to set up the Witch's vote. Player 7 is likely a werewolf, as Player 6 wouldn't give silver water to a good player in a later position. Therefore, I suggest we vote for Player 7 this round, keeping open the possibility that Player 9 is the real seer.

My thought process for protecting myself last night was: If I were to be targeted by the werewolves, I feared the Witch might not use the healing potion, leading to my elimination. As the Guard's elimination would be detrimental to the good team's chances of winning, I chose to protect myself. Number 2, who spoke before me, is a werewolf pretending to be the Guard. As the real Guard, I must reveal myself to everyone; otherwise, if I were to be attacked at night, the good team would continue to be deceived by Number 2. Among the earlier speakers, Numbers 1 and 6 both claim to be the Witch. Number 6 declared Number 7 as their good identity, while Number 1 declared Number 2 as their good identity. Given that I know my role card is the Guard, I believe Numbers 1 and 2 are werewolves pretending to be different roles, and Number 6, who is competing with Number 1 for the Witch role, is the real Witch. I will vote for Number 2 to be eliminated.",

This is absolutely outrageous! Currently, Players 6 and 1 are both claiming to be the Witch. As we know, villagers wouldn't rashly claim to be the Witch to disrupt the game, so between Players 6 and 1, there must be one Witch and one werewolf. Players 2 and 3 are both claiming to be the Guard. Again, villagers wouldn't carelessly claim to be the Guard, so between Players 2 and 3, there must be one Guard and one werewolf. Similarly, between Player 9 and myself (Player 4), there must be one Seer and one werewolf. This means that among the six players claiming special roles, there must be three werewolves. Yet Player 9 claims to have identified Player 7 as a bad identity, which is clearly illogical. Player 7 can only be a villager, otherwise the werewolf composition doesn't make sense. Having analyzed the logic to this point, I believe I don't need to say more. The good team will surely follow me in voting to eliminate Player 9!",

I don't have any special abilities in this round, but I will carefully analyze the situation and try my best to find the hidden werewolves. First, let me analyze the current situation. Number 9 claimed to be the seer and declared Number 7 as a bad identity. Numbers 4 and 9 are both claiming to be the seer, so one of them is a werewolf and the other is the real seer. Numbers 1 and 6 are both claiming to be the witch, so one of them is a werewolf and the other is the real witch. Numbers 2 and 3 are both claiming to be the guard, so one of them is a werewolf and the other is the real guard. Since there are only three werewolves in the game, Number 9's potential werewolf pool includes Numbers 3, 4, 6, and 7, which exceeds the actual number of werewolves. Therefore, Number 9 cannot be the real seer. Number 4 must be the real seer, Number 6 is the witch, and Number 3 is the guard. The three werewolves are Numbers 1, 2, and 9. This round, I will follow Number 4, the seer, to vote for Number 9, the werewolf. I also request Number 6, the witch, to use her poison on Number 1 tonight. Additionally, I hope Number 2, the werewolf, will stop struggling and vote for himself to be eliminated tomorrow.",
