States will vote for player 8 this round, hopes player 9 will use the poison on player 4 at night, and hopes player 2 will protect player 1. Since player 1 is the seer, player 2 is the guard, and player 9 is the witch, player 7 must be a villager.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a villager, believes player 8 is a werewolf.
