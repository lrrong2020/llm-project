I ask the good players in later positions not to attack me on this point. Although Number 2's speech was brief, from my perspective as the Seer, the werewolf positions are already clear: Numbers 3, 4, and 5 are the three werewolves, so Number 2 can only be good. Number 3 claims to be the Witch, stating that they didn't use the potion on Number 9 who was attacked last night. If you, Number 3, are really the Witch, I don't understand why you, as a Witch with both potions, would reveal yourself. Even if you did reveal yourself, you didn't arrange for the Guard to protect you at night, so I believe Number 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch to find the real Witch. Number 5 gave Number 8 a bad identity, which I see as Number 5 trying to challenge the Seer in a later position. Unfortunately, Number 5 almost challenged the real Seer, because I am the Seer. I believe Number 6 is the real Witch. Number 6 carefully analyzed the situation and commented on the players who spoke in earlier positions, while also arranging the Guard's work.

I'm a villager, and as an honest good player, I'll share all the information I know. Since no one has claimed to be the guard, 9 is likely the eliminated guard. I believe last night, the guard chose not to protect anyone, fearing a situation where both the guard and witch would save the same person. The witch didn't use the antidote either, resulting in guard 9 being eliminated by the werewolves. I think there's a high probability that either 2 or 4 is a werewolf. Player 2, speaking first, casually put pressure on the players speaking later, and 4 went along with it. Just because 2 didn't attack 4 in the first speech, 4 accepted 2 as a good player. I think 4 is trying to ally with 2, using this method to survive, so I believe 4 is a werewolf and 2 is a villager. Player 5, who gave me a bad identity, is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, while 7 is the real seer. This round, I will follow seer 7 to vote for player 4, leading to a complete victory for the good team!",
