Player 4 claims to be the Seer, and currently, no one else is claiming this role, so I tentatively believe Player 4 is the real Seer. Player 4 has identified Player 5 as a good identity, and Player 5 claims to be a villager, so I believe Player 5 is indeed a villager. Given that I know I'm a villager, I suspect that among Players 6, 7, and 8, who all claim to be villagers, at least two are werewolves. Comparing the speeches of Players 6, 7, and 8, I find Player 6's speech to be the worst. Player 6's speech lacks logic, merely attacking Player 4 as a werewolf pretending to be a Seer just because Player 4 voted for them. I believe Player 6 is a werewolf with confused logic and irrational behavior. Of course, we haven't heard from the players in later positions yet. I hope if there's a Guard among the remaining players, they will reveal themselves today to help eliminate a potential werewolf position, making it easier for the good team to vote out the werewolves disguised as villagers. Since I'm just a villager, I won't call for votes now. After hearing from Players 1 and 2, I will make my decision based on their speeches and cast my valuable vote to eliminate the werewolf I suspect.",

Since no one else has counter-claimed as the Seer, Player 4 is likely the real Seer.\n\n# What I should do now:\n- **Vote for Player 7**: As a good player, I need to follow the Seer's lead and vote out the werewolf. Therefore, this round I will vote for Player 7, who was identified as a bad identity by Player 4, the Seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I have decided to vote for Player 7.",
