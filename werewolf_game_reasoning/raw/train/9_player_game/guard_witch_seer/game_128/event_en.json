Player 9 then claimed to be the Seer and declared Player 5 as a bad identity. I trust that Player 9 is the real Seer because Player 6 is definitely a werewolf for pretending to be the Witch, which means Player 5, who declared Player 6 as good, must also be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Today, I will follow the lead of Seer Player 9 and vote to eliminate Player 5. Tonight, I plan to use my poison on Player 6.

If players 5 and 6 are both werewolves, and 6 pretends to be the Witch to support his werewolf teammate 5, then 6 would not only be poisoned by the real Witch, but the real Witch would also easily identify that 5 is not the real Seer. This strategy offers no benefit to the werewolf team. Players 1 and 6 both claim to be the Witch, but I believe 6 is the real Witch, and 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch in an attempt to get the Seer (player 9) voted out. I think player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Player 5's speech overall lacks logical reasoning. It's likely that 5 is a werewolf trying to gain credibility by claiming to have verified a good identity for a player in a later position. In my view, 5's behavior is an attempt to gain the trust of good players through verification power, but I believe 5 is an insincere werewolf. On the contrary, not only is player 9 saved by Witch 6, but 9's speech is also very sincere. Player 9's honest speech makes me willing to believe that 9 is the real Seer. Tonight, I will protect player 9. Witch 6 should use the poison to eliminate the small werewolf, player 1. Today, we good players should vote to exile werewolf 5.

If I vote for the Seer (No. 5) and kill the Guard (No. 3) at night, the Guard can protect himself, resulting in a peaceful night. If I kill a villager, I'm likely to be lynched by the good team tomorrow.\n\nPros and cons analysis:\n- Voting for No. 3: The advantage is the possibility of lynching the Guard, allowing us to kill the Seer (No. 5) at night, leading to werewolf victory by eliminating all special roles. The disadvantage is that the votes to lynch No. 3 might be fewer than those for No. 5, potentially resulting in my own elimination.\n- Voting for No. 5: The advantage is that lynching the Seer reduces the good team's special roles, and we can kill the Guard (No. 3) at night to secure victory. The disadvantage is that the Guard has reported not protecting himself last night, so even if we lynch No. 5 today, it will be difficult to kill the Guard tonight.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n- Vote for No. 3: Since all the good players are clearly siding with the Seer (No. 5), I estimate that they will follow the Seer's lead to lynch me. Therefore, lynching either the Guard or the Seer will be challenging. My only option is to take a risk and try to persuade the good players through sincere speech to lynch the Guard (No. 3) today, grasping at the last chance for victory.\n\nIn conclusion, if No. 3 is lynched, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf team.
