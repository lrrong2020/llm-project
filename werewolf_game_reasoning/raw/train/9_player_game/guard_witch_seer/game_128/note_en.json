Calls for votes on player 2. Since I'm a werewolf, player 3 is not my teammate. Player 3 claims to be the Guard, and no other good players are contesting this role, so I analyze that player 3 is likely the real Guard.\n\n- **Player 4**: Believes players 1, 2, and 9 are werewolves. Thinks player 5 is the real Seer, player 6 is the real Witch, and player 3 is the real Guard. Will follow player 5's (Seer's) voting. Since I'm a werewolf, player 4 is not my teammate. Player 4 claimed to be a villager yesterday, so I analyze that player 4 is a villager.\n\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be the Seer, reports player 2 as a bad identity. Calls for votes on player 2 today. Since I'm a werewolf and no other good players are contesting the Seer role with player 5, I analyze that player 5 is the Seer.\n\n- **Player 7**: Continues to side with player 5, believes player 9 is pretending to be the Seer, and players 1 and 2 are player 9's werewolf teammates.

Believes player 6 is the real Witch. Calls for votes on player 2 today. Since I'm a werewolf, player 8 is not my teammate.
