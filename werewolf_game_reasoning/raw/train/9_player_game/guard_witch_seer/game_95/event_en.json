My thought process for checking player 6 was to verify someone one seat away. If player 6 turned out to be a good identity, I could focus on player 5's speech and stance, putting some pressure on them. If player 6 was revealed as a werewolf, we could directly vote them out. Addressing player 6, if I were you, I would immediately pretend to be a seer to save your fellow werewolves from wasting their breath trying to rescue you, which would be a thankless task. Player 3 in the front position claimed to be the Guard, and I believe there's a high probability that they are the real Guard. Because in a situation where no one is contesting the Seer role, claiming to be the Guard offers no benefit for werewolves. So, I kindly ask player 3, the Guard, to protect me tonight, allowing me to safely report my verification results when dawn breaks tomorrow. The Witch in the later position can also reveal themselves if they wish, reporting any players they've saved to help us temporarily identify potential werewolf spots. I will choose to verify the identity of one player after hearing everyone's speeches. For this round, I'm voting for player 6, the werewolf. I ask all good people to trust me and join me in voting out this vicious werewolf, protecting our beautiful homeland!",

No. 6 then claimed to be the seer and declared No. 7 as a bad identity. No. 6's claim is a direct response, which is definitely less convincing than No. 4's. I have a golden rule in Werewolf: It's better to admit being a werewolf than to make an immediate counter-claim! Secondly, from No. 6's perspective, if they truly identified No. 7 as a werewolf, they wouldn't have overlooked No. 5. Between No. 4 and No. 7, there's not only No. 6 but also No. 5. I want to ask No. 6, how did you determine that No. 5 is good based on their brief speech? I believe No. 6 inadvertently revealed their werewolf perspective by assuming No. 5 is good. I think No. 4 is the real seer, and No. 6 is a werewolf. Now we need to consider whether No. 6 and No. 7 are werewolves falsely accusing each other. After being accused, No. 7 claimed to be the guard. It's possible that No. 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the guard to get No. 4, the real seer, voted out. We need to further investigate this point. No. 3 could also be a werewolf pretending to be the guard. I suggest we vote for No. 6 this round.

You're all so capable, so I'll leave the village's protection to you. Just kidding. I think player 3, who spoke first and claimed to be a Guard, is unlikely to be a troublemaking villager, but more likely a werewolf using reverse psychology to gain the trust of good players. Player 4 claimed to be a Seer and accused player 6 of being a werewolf. Player 6 immediately claimed to be a Seer as well and accused player 7 of being a werewolf. I agree with the previous good players that player 6 seems like a werewolf forced to make a claim. Player 5's speech was very ambiguous; they were dissatisfied with player 4's speech, which might be setting the stage for player 6's false Seer claim. Player 5 could be a werewolf. As for player 7, I think they could either be a werewolf pretending to be a Guard, or a villager who panicked after being accused by player 6 and claimed a special role for self-preservation. So I suggest that Seer 4 should verify player 7's identity tonight. Currently, my suspects for werewolves are players 3, 5, and 6. By process of elimination, player 8 seems to be a good player, either a villager or the Witch. I protected player 8 last night, and it turns out I didn't make a mistake. Without hearing from players 1 and 2 yet, I will vote for player 6 this round.",

Player 6 suggested that I'm a suspected werewolf and plans to check my identity tonight. I'd like to ask you, Player 6, why do you suspect me when I haven't even spoken yet? Your intention to check me is extremely displeasing! Moreover, I suspect you're employing reverse psychology. You claim that if you were a werewolf, you wouldn't need to immediately pretend to be a seer and declare Player 7 as a bad identity. However, I believe you were forced to do so to prevent your fellow werewolves from exposing themselves by trying to save you. I'm siding with Player 4. As for the three of you claiming to be the Guard, as a humble villager, I'm not in a position to judge. You're either the real Guard or werewolves. We'll figure out who the true Guard is tomorrow!

They also clearly arranged the roles' tasks, which is exactly what I expect from a Seer. Player 5's speech was practically meaningless, wasting 5 seconds of our time - possibly a werewolf trying to fly under the radar. Player 6 was identified as a werewolf by Player 4, so they were forced to pretend to be a Seer, giving Player 7 a bad identity to gain credibility and hide their werewolf teammate. I believe Player 7 is the Guard; their speech was like a breath of fresh air, with sharp and precise words that were refreshing. They also \"pleaded\" for the Witch to poison Player 3, which fits my definition of a good player. I suspect Players 3, 5, and 6 are the werewolves. Today, all good players should vote for Player 6 to be eliminated. The Witch should poison Player 3 tonight, and tomorrow we'll vote out Player 5. The good team will surely win.
