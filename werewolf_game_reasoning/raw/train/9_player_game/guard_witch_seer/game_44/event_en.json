I believe this is a forced attack on Player 2, as Player 3 also didn't analyze Player 6's identity.

The Seer only needs to analyze based on the fact that there are 3 werewolves left. The good players who have been eliminated, including Player 6, wouldn't know their exact roles, so the Seer doesn't need to focus too much on Player 6. I think Player 4's perspective is similar to mine, which seems like a good player's viewpoint, and likely the first night's neutral identity. I will pay close attention to Player 8's upcoming speech. If Player 8 immediately claims to be the Seer, then Player 2's bad identity claim would be more credible.

I believe No. 5 is the real witch because if No. 5 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to be the witch. If we see two deaths tomorrow, then No. 5 is definitely a werewolf. I won't comment much on the earlier speakers No. 3, 4, and 7. If you're good, I hope you choose the right side. If you're werewolves, I'll leave it to the seer to find you. In this round, I'm only responsible for sharing information.\n\nTo the good players in later positions, No. 2's speech doesn't align with a seer's perspective. A real seer would definitely arrange for the guard to protect the witch, and the witch would save a good player in a later position. The fact that No. 2 could say \"The guard should protect me, and the witch can do as she pleases\" only has one possibility: No. 2 can predict tonight's target. As a werewolf, he definitely knows the werewolves won't target him, and he also knows that the witch has already poisoned No. 6. I hope the good players in later positions understand this logic.\n\nNow, I want to address the guard and the witch: Guard, please protect No. 5; Witch, please save the seer in a later position. Even if I'm voted out today, I hope the witch can create a peaceful night by saving someone. To the seer among No. 9 and No. 1 in later positions, I've done all I can. I hope you can carefully analyze the potential werewolf positions. Remember, the witch has no poison left, and No. 6 was eliminated with an unknown identity.

Number 7 believes that 4 is a good person and the first day's copper water, which indirectly acknowledges 5 as the witch. As a villager, I don't know the night information and don't want to discuss whether 5's witch identity is true, as that's not my role. However, based on 7's speech, I believe 7's identity is lower than 4 and 5. Number 8, claiming to be a villager, thinks 2 is pretending to be a seer. I'm not 8's all-knowing seer, but 8's表水 this round has convinced me. Number 2, as the first-position seer, giving 8 a bad identity is powerful, but the entire speech only focused on 8, which is too narrow-minded. I think 2 might be pretending to be a seer or is the real seer. Currently, only Number 1 is left in the back position. If 1 claims to be the seer, I hope you speak carefully. I will be very strict with 1 because they are the last player to speak and can hear everyone's speeches. If 1 is the real seer, they should have a lot of logic to analyze. Finally, I still think 7's identity is questionable. Regardless of who the seer is, I believe 7 is worth checking.",

That's truly unforgivable! If Player 8 was a werewolf, why didn't they pretend to be a seer? Since I voted for Player 2, why would Player 2, as a Seer, have any reason to check me? Clearly, this is a werewolf who doesn't know how to announce their identity checks and can only give a bad identity to the player who voted for them!

In other words, he's trying too hard to prove his innocence, which actually makes him more suspicious. Last night, the werewolves were quite clever, not revealing their perspective and choosing to attack me. I certainly couldn't save myself. Tonight, the werewolves can come after me again, and I'll definitely be eliminated; if they don't attack me, I can use my healing potion. No. 4's concerns are not unreasonable; I'm also worried that No. 6, whom I poisoned, might be the Seer. Let's see what the later positions have to say.

If 2 is a werewolf, then 1 is the Guard and 5 is the Witch. 3 and 8 are villagers, I'm a villager, so 4 and 7 in the later positions must be the two werewolves. I've always been suspicious of 7's first day speech, but today 7 said I'm a werewolf trying to find someone to vote for in advance. So I won't dispute 2's check tonight, please let 2 check me tonight. Today I'll follow Guard 1's vote, and we'll see 2's check result tomorrow. But if 2 is a werewolf, this vote is the last chance for the good team. 4's suggestion this round \"Let's play like this, vote out 3 today, and let 2 report the check result tomorrow morning\" doesn't work. If 2, who we're siding with, is pretending to be the Seer, and 6 is the real Seer who was poisoned, then if we vote out 3 today, the werewolves will kill Witch 5 tonight. In the next round, the three werewolves will be able to control the vote. I'm just analyzing the consequences of today's vote, but I can't be certain about 6's identity either.

Tomorrow, Players 2, 4, and 7 as the three werewolves can form a majority vote, leading to the collapse of the good team.\n- To maintain balance for both logical possibilities, we choose to vote for Player 2's elimination today, ensuring that at least one werewolf is among Players 2 and 6.\n- Additionally, Player 1, the Guard, is calling for votes against Player 2.\n- **In conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 2.**",

Because the witch blindly poisoned player 6, the real seer, on the first night, the werewolves easily managed to vote out player 8. Fortunately, the guard understood the situation on the second day, but today's speeches seem a bit confused. If you vote me out this round, the remaining werewolves, players 4 and 7, will kill you, player 1, tonight, and the werewolves will win. This game has been quite dramatic - the witch took matters into her own hands and poisoned the seer, a werewolf killed themselves but was saved by the guard resulting in a peaceful night. It's truly a case of truth being stranger than fiction, absolutely unheard of! This round, I urge player 1 to trust your own judgment! Let's review the speeches of players 4 and 7 from yesterday. Weren't they supposed to follow the guard's lead? When the guard voted for player 2, you didn't listen, and instead came to vote for me. Your speech and voting are inconsistent - typical werewolf behavior! Players 1 and 9, see the situation clearly. This round, vote with me to eliminate the werewolves, players 4 and 7!",

Looking at last round's voting results, it's clear that No.3 and No.9 are on the same team. No.9 said last round that they would vote for No.3 along with No.2, but in the end, they still voted for No.2, showing inconsistent behavior typical of a werewolf. Moreover, No.9 attacked me on the first day, giving me reason to suspect that No.9, as the last speaker, was preparing to frame the Seer, which is why they didn't pretend to be a seer. But last round, when the Seer was about to check No.9, No.9 knew they couldn't continue framing and chose to vote out the Seer first. Conveniently, Guard No.1 called for votes against No.2 in the last position last round, and No.9 took advantage of this to vote No.2 out. This round, No.3's speech is extremely exaggerated. First, I never said anything like \"following the Guard\" last round, No.3 is fabricating statements to attack me. Secondly, No.3 claims to vote out both No.4 and No.7 this round, without specifying which one to vote for, suggesting they might have already decided during the night which card to push out. This round, let's first vote for No.3, the bad identity. The Guard should protect themselves tonight, and tomorrow we'll vote for No.9!",

Because now the teams are quite clear, 2, 4, and 7 have been on the same team from the beginning. 3, 8, and I, Villager 9, can probably be considered as one team. First, on day one, 7 said 2's speech was too brief, but didn't define 2's identity, instead assuming 5's identity as the Witch, which seemed like they had inside information. I mentioned this on the first day. So I define 7's identity as lower than 5's, and on the second day, 7 still didn't reveal their identity, but instead attacked me, Villager 9, who had declared my identity on the first day. 7 firmly sided with 2, saying I was a werewolf looking for a scapegoat, without even considering the possibility of 6 being the real Seer. Secondly, if I, number 9, were a werewolf, I wouldn't have needed to vote for 8 to be eliminated on the first day, and then follow the Guard to vote for 2 on the second day. I've been consistently voting with the good team, which would have no benefit for the werewolf team if I were a werewolf. Finally, 7 stood up again today saying that 3 and I are on the same team, but I don't actually know 3. It was you, 2, 4, and 7 who told me that 3 is likely a good identity.
