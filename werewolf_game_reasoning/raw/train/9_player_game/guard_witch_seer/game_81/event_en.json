Moreover, Number 4 chose to vote for Number 9 and sided with Number 8, so I think Number 4 is a werewolf supporting Number 8. In conclusion, I believe the werewolves are Numbers 4, 5, and 8. Today, let's vote for Number 8, whom I identified as a bad identity. Tonight, I'll check Number 4's identity to confirm whether they are a werewolf. Number 5 is pretending to be the Seer, so they don't qualify for verification because they are certainly a fake Seer werewolf. Let me explain why I'm the real Seer: earlier, Number 8 claimed Number 9 was a bad identity, then Number 5 voted for Number 8, and I also identified Number 8 as a bad identity and voted for them. If Number 5 and I were werewolf teammates, there would be no need for me to claim to be the Seer in the last position; I could simply side with Number 5. The fact that I still gave Number 8 a bad identity in the last position shows that I'm not on the same side as Numbers 5 and 8. Therefore, I must be the real Seer, Number 8 is definitely pretending to be the Seer, and we should vote for Number 8 this round.",

I'm afraid Number 4 wants to vote for Number 1 to be eliminated today. I thought I would identify a werewolf card, but Number 4 has a good identity. Let me explain why I voted for Number 7 yesterday. I stated I would verify Number 7, but Number 7 immediately pretended to be a seer. I think Number 7 and Number 8 are werewolves lynching each other, and I believe Number 8 is a card abandoned by their werewolf teammate Number 7, certain to be eliminated. So I voted for Number 7 alone to show the good people that I wouldn't verify Number 7 anymore. We can now be sure that Numbers 7 and 8 are both werewolves, and Number 8 has been eliminated. Let's analyze: if the eliminated Number 2 was a werewolf, Number 7 is the last werewolf on the field; if Number 2 was a villager, either Number 3 or Number 9 is the last werewolf besides Number 7. Based on my verification from the last round, I believe Number 6 is the witch, Numbers 7 and 8 are both werewolves, Number 4 is a villager, Number 3 is likely a villager, and Number 9 is probably a villager too. Otherwise, Numbers 3 and 7 or Numbers 9 and 7 as werewolf pairs would control the game. So Number 2 was likely the werewolf killed by Number 6's poison. With Number 1 guard eliminated, I'm the last special role on the field. We can't vote wrong today. As Number 5 seer, I vote for Number 7.",

Are you trying to steal someone else's verification information? However, it's fine. Both you, player 5, and player 7 have given player 4, a villager who can't discern the situation, a good identity. This makes player 4 the most trusted player in the game, and I can't challenge player 4 anymore. Otherwise, I would have definitely argued with player 4 today! Secondly, player 5 said that voting for player 7 alone was to let the good guys know that they wouldn't check player 7 again. Isn't this already making mistakes during the speech? In your eyes, player 5, player 7 must be, definitely is, absolutely is, certainly is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against you. Do you still need to vote for player 7 alone to prove that you won't check them again? This behavior is utterly ridiculous and laughable! I don't believe player 5 is a seer. Today, I want to vote out player 5, the werewolf, with a unanimous vote!",

The speaking order is 5, then 7.\n- **Player 5**: Gave player 4 a good identity, saying \"So I'm voting for player 7 alone to show the good guys that I won't check player 7 anymore.\" This statement is highly problematic. If 5 were the real seer, from their perspective, 7 would definitely be a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Therefore, 5 wouldn't need to vote for 7 alone to prove they won't check 7. Based on this, I believe 5's perspective is incorrect, and 5 is not the seer.\n- **Player 7**: Checked player 4 as a good identity, overall speech was relaxed, demonstrating a seer's perspective.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Judgments for Other Players Based on the Seer:\n- **Player 5**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 5.",
