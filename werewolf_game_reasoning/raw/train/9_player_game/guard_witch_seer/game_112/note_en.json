As no one claimed to be the witch or guard, they're hiding their identities, so I analyze 9 might be a villager, witch, or guard.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be a villager, suggests the witch should reveal if she used the potion. 1 is my werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a villager, thinks 8 and 9 are likely good, 1 is probably a werewolf. As no one claimed to be the witch or guard, they're hiding their identities, so I analyze 2 might be a villager, witch, or guard.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be a villager, thinks 2 seems like a werewolf, 1 seems good, either 8 or 9 is 2's werewolf teammate, votes for 2. 4 is my werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 5 (myself)**: Claims to be a villager, thinks 8 is a werewolf, 2 is a werewolf teammate protecting 8, chooses to vote between 2 and 8. I am a werewolf.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be the seer, reports 7 as good identity, will check 8 tonight, believes 2 and 9 are good, 4 and 5 are werewolves, chooses to vote between 4 and 5. As werewolves chose a passive strategy, no one challenged 6's seer claim, so 6 is the seer.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be good, sides with 6, believes 3 was good, player 2 is a werewolf, either 8 or 9 (or both) are werewolves. As no one claimed to be the witch or guard, they're hiding their identities, 7 is 6's good identity, so I analyze 7 might be a villager, witch, or guard.\n\n# Subjective identity judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Werewolf\n- **Player 2**: Villager, Witch, or Guard\n- **Player 4**: Werewolf\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Seer\n- **Player 7**: Villager, Witch, or Guard\n- **Player 8**: Villager, Witch, or Guard\n- **Player 9**: Villager, Witch, or Guard\n\n# My vote:\n- I choose to vote for player 2.",
