If it weren't for my keen eye and astute observation, you, Player 2, could have continued coasting! Player 2 claims to be a pitiful villager, but why act so pathetic, you pretentious werewolf? Player 3 stood up and analyzed the identities of Players 5 and 9 at length, without making any defense against the players in later positions who claimed to be the Seer, and didn't arrange any tasks for the special role players at night. This means you, Player 3, are not working for the good side at all! Player 3 stood up and immediately protected Player 2, which is understandable - you must protect your werewolf teammate, Player 2! Today, let's all vote to eliminate Player 2, the confirmed werewolf. If the Witch is still alive, use the poison to kill Player 3, the werewolf pretending to be the Seer, tonight.

No. 6 asked the Witch to use the poison on No. 3, who they claim is pretending to be the Seer, but since there were two deaths on the first night, it means the Witch has no poison left. However, No. 6's statement makes me think they are more likely to be the real Seer because their strong resentment towards No. 3 (who they believe is pretending to be the Seer) and No. 2 (who they identified as a bad identity) aligns with a Seer's intention to eliminate werewolves. In conclusion, I think No. 6 is likely the real Seer, No. 3 is probably pretending to be the Seer, and No. 2 is a werewolf identified by No. 6.

Although No. 6's final statement had a slight flaw - he suggested that the Witch should poison No. 3 who was pretending to be the Seer, but the double death last night indicates that I've already used my poison - it doesn't detract from the overall excellence! No. 6's speech was natural and fluent, with precise wording, extremely persuasive, and convincing. He is absolutely the epitome of a Seer in my mind! It's laughable that the little werewolves No. 2 and No. 3 dare to pretend to be a villager and a Seer! Today, let's vote out No. 2 first. I will use my healing potion tonight to prove my identity as the Witch. No. 8, the Guard, just needs to protect me tonight!",
