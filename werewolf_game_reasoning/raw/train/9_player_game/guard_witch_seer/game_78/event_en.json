Although player 1's claim of player 2 being a bad identity is quite convincing, we can't rule out the possibility that player 2 might actually be the seer who was challenged. Therefore, I've decided to follow player 3 and abstain from voting. If player 3 were a werewolf, they could have directly supported the fake seer instead of saying they can't distinguish who the real seer is after receiving a good identity check. At this point, I can consider player 3 as a good guy. Player 4's comments on player 3 are quite objective, so I think player 4 is likely on the good side. I suspect player 7 might be a werewolf because they're simply repeating player 6's speech. There's a 60-70% chance that player 7 is a passive werewolf just going with the flow. This round, I choose to abstain from voting. If I cast a vote, the witch could immediately use their poison on me!",

The speaking order is Player 1, then Player 2.\n\n- **Player 1**: Declares Player 2 as a bad identity. If Player 1 were a werewolf, the probability of successfully challenging the real seer in the first position is low. Therefore, Player 1 is likely the true seer, and Player 2's speech resembles that of a werewolf who immediately pretends to be a seer after being identified as a bad identity.\n\n- **Player 2**: Declares Player 3 as a good identity. Player 1 was able to accurately challenge Player 2 in the first speech. I believe there's only one possibility: Player 2 is a werewolf who was forced to pretend to be a seer after being identified as a bad identity, attempting to gain trust by declaring a later-speaking good player as a good identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 1 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for Player 2.",
