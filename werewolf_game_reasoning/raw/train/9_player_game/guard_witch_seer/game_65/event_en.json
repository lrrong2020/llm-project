I want to thank you, Number 1, for giving me a bad identity, allowing me to directly side with the seer in the later positions. Today, we should vote out Number 1. Why? Because you're a werewolf. After I clearly saw my identity card as a guard, you claimed I was a bad identity, which means you must be a werewolf! Now, I want to explain to all the good players why Number 1 is a werewolf: First, there's no thought process for verification. A seer would have a corresponding thought process when using their verification ability, but Number 1 didn't show any of this, not even bothering to make it up. Second, lack of perspective. Number 1 suggested the guard protect the witch, which shows no consideration, as Number 4 might have been poisoned, and the witch no longer has an antidote. Number 1 failed to analyze this point, therefore Number 1's speech is typical of a werewolf making mistakes while pretending to have night information. To address Number 1's werewolf teammate in the later positions, I advise you not to pretend to be the guard against me. With my flawless performance, it's inevitable that Number 1 will be unanimously voted out today! If you persist in your delusion and insist on jumping out to charge for Number 1, this evil werewolf, I can only say that you will share the same fate as Number 1, with your life soon coming to an end, about to \"leave your corpse in the wilderness\"! To the seer in the later positions, boldly reveal yourself and share your verification information. Even if I'm voted out today, it will be me, Number 2, the guard, being voted out for you!",

For Player 1 to have such a logical error in such a brief speech exceeds my tolerance, so I don't believe Player 1 is the Seer. Secondly, Player 2 gave a detailed \"essay\" to gain our trust. I find Player 2's sincerity and logic convincing, and that's how I expect a Guard to behave! If Player 2 were a werewolf, I don't think they would try so hard in their speech. This kind of upright attitude doesn't seem like something a werewolf could fake! Player 3's speech was rather vague, so their identity is unclear for now. Today, I'm voting for Player 1 as the werewolf pretending to be the Seer. I'm siding with the Seer who will claim their role in the later positions, hoping another werewolf pretending to be the Guard will also reveal themselves.

Player 3 is not the Guard but questioned Player 2's Guard identity, saying they need to hear later speeches to judge Player 2's identity. However, Player 1, who was identified as a werewolf, has already finished speaking, so who else's speech do you need to hear to make a judgment? I think Player 3 might be a werewolf or a villager, so I'll check Player 3 tonight. Player 5 directly expressed not siding with Player 1 and provided logical and well-founded analysis, so I define Player 5 as likely a good person. As for Players 8 and 9, I haven't heard their speeches yet, so I think they could be werewolves or villagers. I won't make any judgment on the identity of Player 4, who has already been eliminated.

You claim to be the guard and protected No. 6 at night, so even if there was a double protection, No. 6 should have died during the night. But No. 4 died last night, and you're strongly attacking No. 1 for not analyzing that the witch has no more potion, which precisely reveals your werewolf perspective. You killed No. 6 at night, and from a werewolf's view, No. 4 must have died from poison! I don't know if No. 2 and I are guards in the same village, so I can only treat No. 2 as a crazy werewolf pretending to be a seer and speaking nonsense. Based on No. 2's confusing speech, I confirm No. 1 as the real seer today, and I'm voting for No. 2 as the bad identity.

Since player 2 claimed to be the guard and player 6 claimed to be the witch, and their reported use of night abilities is logical, player 2 is established as the true guard, and player 6 is the true witch. Player 7's overall speech is logical and has the perspective of a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgment on this.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 1**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 7.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a guard, confusing the villagers' perspective.

The speaking order is 1, then 7.\n\n- **Player 1**: Declares player 2 as bad identity, calls for votes on 2. As the first speaker, player 1 clearly stated their identity and reported their verification information.\n\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 1 as bad identity, calls for votes on 1. Believes that player 3 (me) is not the guard, and also suspects player 2's guard identity. Player 7 thinks my \"need to listen to later speeches\" behavior is not good.\n\n- I believe player 7's reason for attacking player 3 (me) is unfounded. As a good player, I still have five players from 5 to 9 who haven't spoken, so of course I need to listen to all speeches before making a judgment on true and fake seers. Therefore, I think player 7's attack on me seems like a werewolf preparing to vote me out tomorrow.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 1 is the true seer, and based on this, we make our judgment.\n\n# Identity judgments and analysis of other players based on the seer's information:\n\n- Player 2 was declared bad identity by player 1, claims to be the guard, believes that player 1 didn't consider the possibility of player 4 being poisoned by the witch, and uses this as a reason to attack player 1 as a werewolf. I think player 2's reason for attacking player 1 is unreasonable, because as a seer, one only needs to find the werewolves on the field and vote them out. The reason for player 4's elimination is not the focus for the seer on the first day.\n\n- Player 8's speech also indicates that player 2 is pretending to be the guard and has no reasonable grounds to attack player 1, suggesting player 2 is a werewolf. Player 8's definition of player 2 is similar to mine. I think player 8 is more likely to be the true guard.\n\nBased on this judgment:\n\n- **Player 7**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 1.\n- **Player 2**: Is the werewolf verified by player 1, pretending to be the guard.\n- **Player 8**: Is the true guard.\n\n- I choose to side with player 1 as the seer. With a bad identity declared, we should vote for that player first.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 2, who was declared as bad identity by player 1.",

Number 2 could also potentially be a werewolf. If Number 2 is a werewolf, then the werewolves' advantage would be that Numbers 1 and 2 are pretending to be each other's roles, and tricking the real Guard to side with the wrong team. Yesterday, the only thing I could be certain of was that Number 1 is a werewolf. I couldn't definitively say that Number 2 is the Guard and Number 8 is a werewolf, so I chose to check Number 8 between Numbers 2 and 8 last night. It turns out Number 8 is indeed a werewolf, and Number 2 is indeed the Guard. Today, you can vote for Number 8, the werewolf, without any hesitation! Let me further explain to Numbers 5 and 9 why Number 8 is a werewolf, to help you make a judgment: The reason Number 8 is a werewolf is that when he claimed to be the Guard, he didn't question whether Numbers 1 and 2 could possibly be werewolves checking each other. Number 8 believed Number 1 was the Seer without any reason. Put yourself in my shoes: if I were a werewolf, wouldn't I have guessed that the real Guard is either Number 8 or Number 9? Wouldn't it be more convincing and easier to gain the trust of good people if I had declared Number 8 or Number 9 as a bad identity, rather than Number 1? I hope Numbers 5 and 9 can stick to their own judgment and vote together to eliminate Number 8, the werewolf!",
