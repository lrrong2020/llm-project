Player 6 expressed disbelief in player 2 being the witch, yet considered player 5 to be good, saying that player 5's thoughts aligned with theirs. However, player 5 actually believes in player 2's witch identity. Thus, I suspect player 6 is a werewolf, and player 5 might be their werewolf teammate who miscommunicated.

However, player 3 only said that player 8 was \"likely\" good, not definitively \"determined\" to be good. I believe player 7 is distorting player 3's statement to attack them as a werewolf, so player 7 is probably a werewolf who's altering others' statements.

Player 9, the Seer, mentioned that player 7 misrepresented player 3's speech. I agree with player 9's observation. I believe that good players have no reason to misrepresent others' speeches; only werewolves would do this to mislead other good players and potentially vote for the player whose speech was misrepresented. Therefore, player 7 is likely a werewolf. Moreover, player 9, the Seer, has explicitly called for votes against player 7. If I were to vote for another player at this point, it would cause the good team to split their votes. Thus, I've decided to vote for player 7.\n\nIn conclusion, I've decided to cast my vote for player 7.",
