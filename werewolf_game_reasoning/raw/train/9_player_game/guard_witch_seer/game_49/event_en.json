No. 5 is No. 7's bad identity, so for now, we'll consider him good. Tonight, I'll check No. 6. If No. 6 turns out to be a good identity, then No. 8 should look for werewolves among No. 2, 3, and 4 to challenge! I believe players with ambiguous speeches are most likely to be werewolves, especially when No. 7 finished speaking, you said \"from a villager's perspective,\" as if you're a werewolf trying to adopt a villager's viewpoint, rather than naturally being a villager. So, I can't rule out suspicion on No. 8. If No. 7's teammate wants to back him up by also claiming to be a seer, go ahead. It'll save me the trouble of checking.",

However, I won't immediately side with 9; I just feel 9's conversational tone is relatively relaxed. I'll decide who to side with after hearing 5's speech about their identity check. I believe 8 is a good person because 8's questioning of why 7 would choose to check between 1 and 3 suggests they might not be on the same team. Additionally, 9's action of putting 8 up for elimination also indicates that 8 and 9 might not be on the same side, so 8 seems to be an independent good person. 9's characterization of 8 doesn't quite align with my perspective. Considering all this, balancing 9's demeanor and speech, I've decided not to take sides for now.",

Player 3, your criticism of player 9, asking them to report their checks properly, seems a bit harsh and tends towards forced accusation. Player 9 could simply be a more lively and energetic Seer. Now that the werewolves know my identity as the Witch, they will surely rush to vote me out to prevent me from using my poison. I ask my fellow villagers not to scatter their votes on players 7 or 9, but to vote between players 2 and 5.

If No. 9 is the seer, No. 5 would have been eliminated yesterday, and No. 9 should have died last night, so why did No. 8 die? If No. 7 is the seer, the werewolf team might think No. 2 would choose between No. 3 and No. 4 to use the poison, so they killed a villager in the later speaking position. Therefore, I believe No. 8's death likely indicates that No. 7 is the true seer. No. 1, No. 5, and No. 9 might be the three werewolves. Yesterday, No. 1's speech seemed to support No. 9 while also trying to claim No. 8, whom I consider a good identity. No. 5 claimed to be the witch, supported No. 9, but voted for No. 2, who is suspected to be the witch. I believe with two seers present, those with a bad identity should follow the bad identity, those without should vote for the suspected werewolf pretending to be a seer. Not supporting either side and voting for players in later speaking positions is not a good move. This round, I will likely continue to support No. 7, unless No. 9 and No. 1 give particularly convincing speeches.",

The werewolves are probably No. 2, No. 4, and No. 7. Last round, No. 4's speech sounded like a werewolf when they said, \"But No. 2's good identity is from No. 7, I have to consider the possibility of werewolves killing one of their own to defraud the witch's potion. I see only No. 3 in the front positions supporting No. 7.\" How can they consider the possibility of werewolves killing their own and still support No. 7? Last round, No. 7's accusation of No. 5 as a bad identity was too strong, and No. 2 in the front position claimed to be the Witch early on. I absolutely don't believe that No. 5 would claim to be the Witch after being accused of a bad identity. It seems No. 5 was the real Witch who was eliminated. Today, we should definitely vote out No. 2. I'm the Guard, I protected No. 7 last night and can protect No. 9 tonight. No. 9, please rest assured that I will definitely protect you tonight!",

As a witch, poisoning werewolves is her duty. So, 2's speech today is a werewolf-revealing one. I believe 2 and 7 are both werewolves. Although 5's speech yesterday wasn't convincing, the night's death information is the most reliable. As the seer, my speech is naturally relaxed. Only werewolves pretending to be seers would try to be overly logical and flawless. I think 1 has keen insight, worthy of being my good identity. Today I vote for 2, because the villagers might not be able to distinguish between me and 7 as the real seer, so you can keep both of us for now. Eliminating both 2 and 5 ensures at least one werewolf is out, and I really can't recognize 5's speech yesterday as that of a witch. 5 said: \"Vote out 2 today, because if we vote out 7 today, you won't be able to tell who the real witch is tonight.\" I beg to differ, because to distinguish the real witch, we just need to see who gets poisoned at night. It's still easy to tell. So regardless of whether 2 or 5 is the real witch, since the antidote has been used, voting both of them out is the safest option. I almost forgot to mention, 6, who I checked last night, is a good identity. Actually, who I check at night doesn't matter anymore, because with one werewolf between 2 and 5, 7 being a werewolf, 6 confirmed as good, and 4 proven to be a werewolf pretending to be a guard, we've found all three werewolves. Anyway, 7 has already declared 1 as bad identity today, I believe 1 can now see who the real seer is. Let's all vote for 2!",
