Believes Player 6 is not the Witch, suggests the Witch should reveal herself. Will protect the Witch tonight. Tentatively thinks Player 3 is good and Player 5 might be a werewolf. Likely to side with the Seer who speaks later.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a villager. Believes Player 7 is the real Guard and Player 5 is a werewolf. Sides with the Seer who speaks later and will vote for Player 5 today.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the Witch, says she saved Player 6 last night. Thinks Player 6 died due to simultaneous protection and saving. Believes Player 7 is not the real Guard and that Players 7 and 8 are werewolves. Sides with Player 5 and will vote for Player 8. Plans to poison the werewolf pretending to be the Witch tonight. If no one else claims to be the Witch, she'll poison Player 7.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the Witch, says she didn't use the potion last night. Thinks Player 9 is a werewolf, Player 7 is the real Guard, and is unsure about Player 5's identity. Will decide on voting after hearing Player 2's speech. Asks the Guard to protect her tonight and plans to poison Player 9.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Seer, declares Player 9 as a bad identity. Believes Player 7 is the Guard.

I agree with Player 3's view on the witch claiming her identity, so I think Player 3 is likely a real villager.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be a villager, expresses uncertainty about Player 6's identity, hopes the seer in the later position can speak well. I think Player 4's speech is rather vague, so Player 4 might be a non-special villager or a werewolf giving an ambiguous speech.\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be the seer and declares Player 8 as a bad identity. Thinks Players 3, 4, and 6 could be villagers or werewolves. States they will vote for Player 8 and check Player 3 or 4's identity tonight. Since Player 9, who is pretending to be the witch, supports Player 5, I believe Player 5 is Player 9's werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 7**: I am the guard, I didn't protect anyone last night. I think Player 6 is a villager, werewolf, or seer. I think Player 3 might be good, and Player 5 might be pretending to be the seer.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a villager, believes Player 7 (me) is the guard, thinks Player 5 is pretending to be the seer. States they will vote for Player 5. Since Player 5, who is pretending to be the seer, declared Player 8 as a bad identity, I analyze that Players 5 and 8 are likely not on the same team, so Player 8 is probably a villager.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the witch, states they saved Player 6 last night. Believes Player 7 (me) is a werewolf pretending to be the guard, thinks Players 5 and 7 (me) are werewolves who met at night. States they support Player 5 and will vote for Player 8. Since I didn't protect Player 6 last night, Player 9's explanation for Player 6's death due to simultaneous protection and saving is invalid, so Player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the witch, states they didn't use the potion last night. Believes Player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch, thinks Player 7 (me) is the real guard. Expresses uncertainty about whether Player 5 is the seer or pretending to be one, hopes Player 7 (me) will protect Player 1 at night, and plans to poison Player 9 tonight. Since Players 1 and 9 both claim to be the witch, and Player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch, Player 1 is the real witch.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the seer and declares Player 9 as a bad identity, believes Player 7 (me) is the guard. States they will prioritize voting for Player 9 and hopes the witch will poison Player 5. Since Player 5 is pretending to be the seer, Player 2, who is competing with Player 5 for the seer role, is the real seer.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Witch\n- **Player 2**: Seer\n- **Player 3**: Villager\n- **Player 4**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **Player 7**: Guard\n- **Player 8**: Villager\n- **Player 9**: Werewolf\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 9.",
