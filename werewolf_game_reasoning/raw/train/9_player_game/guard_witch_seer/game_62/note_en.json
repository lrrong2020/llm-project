The werewolves attacked No.7, but I used the potion to save them, resulting in a peaceful night.\n- **Day Information**:\n  - The speech order starts from No.8.\n\n# Speech and Behavior Analysis\n- **Player 8**:\n  - Claimed to be the Seer, declared No.9 as bad identity, and called for votes against No.9.\n  - Speech was brief, unable to determine if they are the real Seer.\n- **Player 9**:\n  - Claimed to be a villager, accused No.8 of being a werewolf.\n  - Failed to convince others, didn't provide logical reasons why No.8 must be a werewolf.\n- **Player 1**:\n  - Claimed to be the Seer, declared No.3 as good identity, waited for No.2's stance, believed No.9 is likely a good person.\n  - Focused mostly on No.2's position, didn't mention No.4, 5, 6, 7 at all. Unable to determine if they are the real Seer.\n- **Player 2**:\n  - Myself, the Witch. Stated inability to determine the real Seer, suggested voting for No.9.\n- **Player 3**:\n  - Believed No.8 is the Seer, reasoning that No.1 was too critical of No.2, which doesn't align with a Seer's mentality.\n  - No.3 changed their stance, likely a good person.\n- **Player 4**:\n  - Due to No.3's change of stance, believed No.3 is good. Decided to follow No.3 and vote for No.9 this round.\n- **Player 5**:\n  - Agreed with No.2's thoughts, followed No.2 to vote for No.9's elimination.\n  - Didn't discuss their own logic, followed No.2's lead, suspected to be a werewolf.\n- **Player 6**:\n  - Claimed to be a villager, believed No.9 is a werewolf making unnecessary speeches. Couldn't distinguish between No.8 and No.1 as the real Seer.\n  - Believed No.9 is a werewolf but couldn't identify the Seer, therefore No.6 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player 7**:\n  - Claimed to be a villager, couldn't distinguish between No.8 and No.1 as the real Seer, stated they would abstain from voting this round.\n\n# Identity Predictions for This Round\n- **No.1**: Werewolf or Seer\n- **No.2**: Witch\n- **No.3**: Villager\n- **No.4**: NA\n- **No.5**: Werewolf\n- **No.6**: Werewolf\n- **No.7**: NA\n- **No.8**: Werewolf or Seer\n- **No.9**: Werewolf or Villager",
