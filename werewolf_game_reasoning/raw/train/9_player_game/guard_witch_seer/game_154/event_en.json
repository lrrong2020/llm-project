Player 7 sided with Player 3 without listening to the speeches of the competing Seers.

This means player 3 must be pretending to be a seer. Player 3 is likely trying to challenge a seer in a later position, but unfortunately, I'm just a villager. Since no seer has appeared in the earlier positions, my true seer must be player 2, who hasn't spoken yet. First, I want to tell everyone that I'm truly a good person. Secondly, if I were a werewolf, I definitely wouldn't choose to have my werewolf teammate claim to be a seer, as this would expose them. Players 4 and 5 said exactly the same thing, which has no value. They both thanked the witch for using the potion to ensure a peaceful night, but why couldn't it have been the guard who protected someone? I think players 4 and 5 are werewolves with information. Player 6 claims to be the witch, and player 8 claims to be the guard. No one has challenged their identities, so I believe player 6 is the witch and player 8 is the guard. In my opinion, the werewolves are likely players 3, 4, and 5. This round, I will vote for player 3, who is pretending to be a seer, to be eliminated. Next, I invite my true seer, player 2, to speak.",

However, since player 6 is already known to be good, player 2's claim lacks credibility. Player 3, on the other hand, claimed to be a seer in the first position and dared to give a bad identity to a later speaker, not afraid of accusing a god role. Therefore, I believe player 3's verification is more convincing, and player 3 is more likely to be the real seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\nIdentity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- Player 2: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 3.\n- Player 1: A werewolf verified by seer 3.\n\nRanking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 1=2\n- Since player 1 is the werewolf verified by seer 3, seer 3 calls for a vote against player 1. As a good player, I should prioritize lynching the werewolf verified by the seer to avoid split voting. Therefore, I decide to vote for werewolf 1.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 1.",

Players 4 and 5 both stated in their speeches that they would not choose sides and would listen to the later players' speeches. I believe if Players 4 and 5 were werewolves, they could have worked for their werewolf teammates in the earlier positions, but they didn't work for any player in their speeches. So I think Players 4 and 5 are most likely good players. Player 1, after being declared as a bad identity by Player 3, believes that Players 3, 4, and 5 are the three werewolves. Since Players 7 and 9 sided with Player 3 (who Player 1 sees as a werewolf) without hearing from the later players, if Player 1 were a good player, they should think that Players 7 and 9 are likely werewolves. However, Player 1 doesn't consider Players 7 and 9 as werewolves, but instead thinks that Players 4 and 5, who didn't express their stance, are Player 3's werewolf teammates. Therefore, I believe Player 1's logic is flawed, so I think Player 1 is a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 1.",
