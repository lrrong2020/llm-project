I won't bully him, I'm also voting for Player 9 who's pretending to be the Seer! My earlier speech was just a joke. I'm voting for Player 9 only to make the good players recognize me as the real Seer. I hope the good players can understand my good intentions.

Firstly, the credibility of No.9 giving a good identity to a later speaker is much higher than No.2 giving a bad identity to an earlier speaker. This is one factor that makes No.9 more likely to be the real Seer. Secondly, if we assume No.2 is the Seer, why would No.1, as a werewolf, be so eager to pretend to be the Guard after receiving a good identity from No.9? Shouldn't werewolves try their best to hide their identities? If No.1 were a werewolf, after receiving a good identity from their werewolf teammate No.9, there would be no need to risk exposing themselves by pretending to be the Guard, because the real Guard in a later position would definitely jump out and attack No.1! Following this logic, I believe that No.1, who claimed to be the Guard in the second speech this round, is likely the real Guard. No.2's behavior, on the other hand, is like walking into a trap. Even though your speech content is richer, No.2, I can't believe your Seer identity! I'm siding with No.9 directly. This round, I'm voting for No.2 as the werewolf pretending to be the Seer. I also welcome any werewolf in a later position to pretend to be the Guard, so that my great Seer can directly verify the last werewolf!",

First, let's look at Player 9's speech. I find it unremarkable and without any revealing mistakes, making it difficult to determine if they're the Seer or a werewolf. Now, Player 1's speech: they claim to be the Guard and support Player 9. If Player 1 is a werewolf, they might have received a good identity claim from their werewolf teammate Player 9 and then pretended to be the Guard. Their aim would be to mislead the villagers and flush out the real Guard. This suggests that Players 1 and 9 could be a werewolf duo. Therefore, Player 2's speech becomes crucial. Let's examine Player 2's statement. They claim to be fully committed to the game and have an advantage, but their speech contains significant flaws. Player 2 mentions that villagers in later positions might think they want the Guard eliminated. Villagers would typically try to determine if Player 1 is the real Guard, but Player 2's speech assumes Player 1's Guard identity. It's as if the Seer is telling the villagers, \"This werewolf is the Guard.\" I consider this a major mistake, leading me to believe Player 2 might not be the Seer. In conclusion, I think Player 9 is the Seer, Player 1 is the Guard, and Player 2 is a werewolf. This round, I will vote for Player 2.",

If you don't dare to vote out Player 1, the werewolf pretending to be a Guard, then vote for Player 9, the fake Seer werewolf. There's no problem with Player 2 calling for votes against Player 9, the werewolf, because from the good team's perspective, it's impossible to distinguish between Player 1 and Player 6 as the real Guard, and voting out the real Guard on the first day would be very disadvantageous for the good team.

The guard in a later position would certainly attack player 1.

There are flaws in Player 7's speech logic: \"Player 2 called for votes on Player 9, Player 6 called for votes on Player 1. I think if Player 6 were a werewolf, they wouldn't make such a basic mistake.\" This statement doesn't come from a good player's perspective, can't support a good identity, lacks proper viewpoint, and only analyzes one-sided logic without considering the possibility of Players 2 and 6 both being werewolves.\n\nRanking of werewolf possibilities:\n- Players 2, 6, 7 > Players 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 2.",
