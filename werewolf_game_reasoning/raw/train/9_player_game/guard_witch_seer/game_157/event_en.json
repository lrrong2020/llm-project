This allowed No. 8 to attack No. 6 and No. 7 recklessly. I believe No. 9 lacks the perspective of a true Seer and is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer, eager to divert votes from good players. Today, I will follow and vote with the later-positioned Seer No. 5. No. 3 claimed to be the Witch and reported No. 9 as saved by the potion but didn't side with No. 9, which I think shows the reasoning of a genuine Witch. In conclusion, I believe No. 3 is the real Witch, No. 5 is the real Seer, No. 8 is a true villager, and No. 9 is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. I have seen through the werewolves' scheme.

I initially couldn't determine Player 6's identity due to their vague speech from an earlier position, but Player 7's statement indicates that Player 6's ambiguous speech is characteristic of a good person. This suggests that Player 7 knows Player 6 is good, implying they have insider information. I believe everyone can deduce from this that Player 7 is a werewolf. I think Player 1 is good because, in a scenario where Players 1 and 9 are both werewolves, Player 1's speech offers no benefit to the werewolf team. Since Player 6's good identity was revealed by Player 7 (a werewolf), I can confirm that Players 1 and 6 are good. Since Player 3, the Witch, has already sided with me, I ask you to use your poison on Player 9, the werewolf pretending to be a Seer, tonight. I will verify Player 8's identity tonight.
