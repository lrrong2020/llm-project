Therefore, Player 3 can't possibly be a real seer. If Player 3 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, then Player 1, who also claimed to be a seer, must be the real one. Player 2 immediately sided with Player 1 after hearing their speech. I believe if Player 2 were a werewolf, this action would have no benefit, so Player 2 is likely a good player. Players 4 and 6 in the front positions both claimed to be the witch, but they reported different causes of death for Player 5. Since the guard knows the real cause of Player 5's death, if Player 4 were the real witch, it wouldn't make sense for Player 6 to pretend to be the witch and report different information after Player 4 had already stated the cause. This is because if the guard were to reveal the truth, everyone would immediately know who the real witch is, exposing the fake witch and rendering Player 6's pretense meaningless. Therefore, I believe Player 6 is the real witch, which means Player 4, who also claimed to be the witch, is a werewolf. Today, I will side with Player 1 and vote for Player 3.",

Since I, player 2, am a good player, yet player 3 directly identified me as a werewolf, and player 3 only heard from players 1 and 2 before claiming to have found three werewolves, completely ignoring the speeches of later players, I believe player 3 lacks the thought process of a Seer, doesn't have a Seer's perspective, and very much resembles a werewolf who panicked after being identified as bad.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 1 is the true Seer, and I decide to vote for player 3.",
