Players 1 and 3 both claimed to be the Seer. Since Player 3 claimed to be the Seer immediately after being identified as bad by Player 1, statistically, it's less likely for a werewolf pretending to be the Seer to successfully identify the real Seer in a later position. Player 3 seems more like a werewolf forced to pretend to be the Seer after being identified. Therefore, Player 1 is more likely to be the real Seer.\n- **Player 2**: Claimed to be a villager, believed Player 1 was the Seer, voted for Player 3. Since all three special roles have been claimed, Player 2 can only be a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 3**: Claimed to be the Seer, identified Player 7 as bad identity, believed Players 1, 2, and 7 were the three werewolves, voted for Player 7.\n- **Player 4**: Claimed to be the Witch, stated that Player 5 was eliminated due to simultaneous protection and rescue, voted for Player 3, believed Player 1 was the real Seer. Since I, Player 9, the Guard, did not protect anyone last night, Player 4 is lying. A real Witch wouldn't fabricate false night information to confuse the good team's perspective, so Player 4 can only be a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.\n- **Player 6**: Claimed to be the Witch, didn't save Player 5 who was attacked last night, believed Player 4 was a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, believed Player 1 was the Seer, suggested the Guard protect Player 6 tonight, planned to poison Player 4 tonight, voted for Player 3. Since Player 6 reported the correct night information, Player 6 is the real Witch.\n- **Player 7**: Claimed to be a villager, believed Player 3 was a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, believed Player 1 was the Seer, believed Player 2 was good, believed Player 6 was the real Witch, believed Player 4 was a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, supported Player 1, voted for Player 3. Since all three special roles have been claimed, Player 7 can only be a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 8**: Claimed to be a villager, supported Player 1, believed one of Players 4 and 6 was a werewolf and the other was the Witch, believed Player 3 was a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, voted for Player 3.
