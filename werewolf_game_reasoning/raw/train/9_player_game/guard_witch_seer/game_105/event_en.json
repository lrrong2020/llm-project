I was concerned that the Werewolf with the highest number might kill themselves to deceive the Witch into using her potion, so I protected Player 9, who has the highest number. At dawn, seeing Player 9 eliminated, I suspect it was due to a simultaneous protection and rescue. Player 9's identity is currently undefined; they could be a villager who was attacked, a Witch who saved herself, a Werewolf who killed themselves to deceive, or a Seer who didn't have time to report their verification. Basically, Player 9 could be any role except the Guard. Since I, as the Guard, have chosen to reveal myself today, I want to cross-check information with the Witch. If the Witch is in a later speaking position, please don't reveal yourself today. We shouldn't let the Werewolves locate all three special roles, preventing them from winning by eliminating all the special characters or villagers. Tonight, I will protect the Seer, allowing them to report their second night's verification. The Seer in a later position should remember their verification target for tonight. Players 1 and 2 claim to be villagers but their speeches were vague, so their identities are still undefined. I hope the Seer in a later position will speak well. I will choose my stance based on the speeches and cast my valuable vote accordingly.",

I solemnly declare to you all that I am the only true Seer in this game. My reasoning for checking player 5 was to verify someone nearby. If they had turned out to be a good identity, it would have helped me find the hidden werewolves, but player 5 is a werewolf. The speeches of players 1 and 2 in the front positions were similar, without providing useful information. Their identities cannot be defined; they could be civilians with no night actions or werewolves who are laying low. If the speeches of the players in later positions are good, I will check either player 1 or 2 tonight. Player 3 claimed to be the Guard, their speech was logically clear and orderly, analyzing the situation from a good person's perspective. They commented on players 1 and 2 who had already spoken, and also made predictions about player 9 who was eliminated during the night. So, I believe player 3 is the Guard. Finally, I emphasize again that I am the Seer, and my verification results are true and reliable. Please trust me and vote with me to eliminate player 5, the werewolf.

Player 5 hopes someone in the later positions will claim to be the Seer, which indicates that Player 5 must have a werewolf teammate in the later positions. Player 5 wants their werewolf teammate to pretend to be the Seer to save them, so I believe at least one of Player 6 or Player 8 should be a werewolf. Players 1 and 2's speeches were very vague, and I really can't determine their identities. Player 3 claimed to be the Guard, and currently, no one else has claimed this role, so for now, I believe Player 3 is the real Guard.

I can only assume that the Guard also protected No. 9, resulting in their death due to the \"same protection, same rescue\" rule. No. 9 was likely a villager because the werewolves wouldn't know if I had used my potion, so they wouldn't pretend to be the Guard to verify last night's information with me. Also, no one has questioned No. 3, so I believe No. 3 is the real Guard. I'm wondering if No. 9 could have been the Seer, as only No. 4 has claimed to be the Seer. No. 4 might be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, while No. 9 was the real Seer. No. 4 declared No. 5 as a bad identity, but No. 5 claims to be a villager. I find No. 5 quite credible because they haven't claimed any special role, essentially putting their fate in our hands. However, since only No. 4 has claimed to be the Seer, I'll respect my own role and follow No. 4's lead by voting to eliminate No. 5 today. Tonight, I'll use my poison on either No. 1, 2, 6, or 7.

Therefore, Player 4 is the uncontested Seer on the field.\n\nBased on Player 4 being the uncontested Seer, here's the analysis:\n\nAssuming the eliminated Player 9 was not the Seer, Player 4 is the real Seer, which means Player 5 is a werewolf. I believe at least one of the later-speaking players, Player 6 or Player 7, must be a werewolf. This would explain why Player 5 chose to claim villager instead of directly pretending to be the Seer. However, I can't understand why the werewolf among Player 6 and Player 7 didn't pretend to be the Seer to save Player 5, and instead turned against them. Therefore, I deduce two possibilities: One is that Players 6 and 7 are not in the same werewolf team as Player 5, meaning they are both good players. The other possibility is that the werewolf among Players 6 and 7 decided to abandon their werewolf teammate, Player 5, after seeing them receive the bad identity claim.\n\nOverall, I believe Player 4 is likely the real Seer, and Player 5 is probably a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote for Player 5 this round.",
