This can only mean that the Witch didn't use the healing potion last night. None of the players who spoke before me claimed to be the Witch, and only Player 8 hasn't spoken yet, so Player 8 is likely to be the Witch. If Player 8 is indeed the Witch, then Player 3 is currently the uncontested Seer, which means Player 3 is probably the real Seer. If Player 8 is the Witch, I will protect the Witch tonight. If Player 3 dies, the Witch should use the healing potion to save Player 3. Tomorrow night, I'll protect Player 3, the Seer, allowing them to check at least two more players' identities. I think Player 4 seems like a genuine Villager because they were giving sincere advice to the Witch and Guard, so Player 4 should be on the good side. For now, I support Player 3. Player 3's bad identity is Player 2, so we should vote for Player 2 today. I'll wait to hear Player 8's speech before making a final decision.",

If the Witch always chooses to save someone on the first night, the werewolves will exploit this weakness. They might kill one of their own to trick the Witch into using her potion and then pretend to be the Seer after dawn. So, I didn't save No. 5 last night. Given the current situation, I believe No. 5 was likely a werewolf who sacrificed themselves, while the remaining werewolves chose not to claim any special roles in order to survive. As I'm the last to speak, and No. 3 is the only Seer on the field, I choose to support No. 3. If No. 3 is targeted tonight, I will use my potion to save them.
