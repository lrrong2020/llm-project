No. 2 and No. 3 both claim to be the Seer, but their speeches are mediocre. Neither of them commented on the players who spoke before them, nor did they arrange the Guard's work for the night. I don't think either of them has the Seer's perspective. I might abstain from voting this round and observe No. 2 and No. 3's speeches tomorrow. No. 1's speech was extremely brief, just a couple of sentences, yet they dare to think No. 9 is a slacking werewolf? In my opinion, No. 1 seems more like a slacking werewolf, and I'm going to use my poison on No. 1 tonight. I believe No. 1 is a werewolf, one of No. 2 and No. 3 is a werewolf while the other is the Seer, and the last werewolf is hiding among the players claiming to be villagers.",

Secondly, Player 3 already has one bad identity check against them, yet they still gave Player 9 a bad identity check. If Player 3 were a werewolf, this would inevitably cause them to lose the trust of two players. Moreover, Player 3 already knows that Player 2 is the seer, so giving a bad identity check to a player in a later position wouldn't successfully challenge the seer's role anymore. Therefore, I believe if Player 3 were a werewolf, it would be more appropriate to give a good identity check to a player in a later position rather than a bad identity check. Considering these two points, I might side with Player 3 this round and vote for Player 9.",
