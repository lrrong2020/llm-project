The fact that they didn't suggests Player 7 and Player 1 might be on the same side. In other words, if Player 1 is a werewolf, Player 7 might also be one.\n\nPlayer 1 attacked Player 2 in this round, even though from Player 1's perspective, Player 2 hasn't spoken yet and their identity is unknown. On what basis is Player 1 attacking Player 2? If Player 1 is a villager and Player 2 is the Witch, can Player 1 guarantee that Player 2 won't use the poison on them due to this hostility? If the village team loses because Player 2 poisons Player 1, who would be responsible?\n\nIn my view, Player 1 doesn't have a villager's mindset.

Therefore, I believe one of them is likely a villager and the other a werewolf.

However, since Player 8 was eliminated on the first night, I cannot be certain that Player 6 is definitely the seer. Further analysis is needed.\n\n# Seer identity assessment:\n- **Player 6**: If Player 8 is not the seer, then Player 6 is the only seer, and Player 7 is a werewolf.\n- **Player 8**: There's a possibility that Player 8, who was eliminated on the first night, could have been the seer. However, the probability of Player 8 being the seer is only 1/8, which is extremely low.\n- In conclusion, the probability of Player 8 being the seer is extremely low. Additionally, in my speech, I also mentioned that Players 1 and 7 could potentially be a pair of werewolves. Therefore, from my perspective, Player 6's claim of Player 7 being a bad identity is highly credible.\n\n# In summary, I side with Player 6 and vote to eliminate Player 7 this round.",
