My analysis: Player 5 is the sole Guard, I think Player 5 is the real Guard.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be the Seer, gives Player 3 a bad identity, thinks Player 2 is the Witch, Players 3 and 5 are werewolves, believes the Guard is among Players 7, 8, and 1, wants to vote out Player 3, hopes the Guard protects Player 2, and Player 2 (Witch) poisons Player 5. My analysis: Player 6 gives Player 3 (Witch) a bad identity, I think Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a villager, thinks Player 3 is the Witch, Players 2 and 6 are werewolves, wants to vote out Player 6. Analysis: Player 7 claims to be a villager, I'm a villager, I think Player 7 might be a villager.\n\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be the Seer, gives Player 9 a bad identity, thinks Player 2 is a werewolf, Player 5 is the Guard, Player 3 is the Witch, wants to vote out Player 6. My analysis: Since I think Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, I believe Player 8 is the real Seer.\n\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be a villager, thinks Players 2, 6, and 9 are werewolves, Player 3 is the Witch, Player 5 is the Guard, Player 8 is the Seer, the remaining Players 1, 4, and 7 are all villagers. I will vote to eliminate Player 6 (werewolf) today, the Witch should poison Player 2 (werewolf) tonight, and ask the Guard to protect Player 1. I am a villager.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Villager\n- **Player 2**: Werewolf\n- **Player 3**: Witch\n- **Player 4**: Villager\n- **Player 5**: Guard\n- **Player 6**: Werewolf\n- **Player 7**: Villager\n- **Player 8**: Seer\n- **Player 9**: Werewolf\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 6.",
