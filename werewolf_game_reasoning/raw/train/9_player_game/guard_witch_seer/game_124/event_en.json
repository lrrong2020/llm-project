At the same time, Player 1 thought Players 7 and 8 were not contributing, while in my opinion, Player 1's speech was even less contributive. Therefore, I define Player 1 as probably a werewolf. I believe Player 9 is the Guard because I judge that if Player 9 were a werewolf, they probably wouldn't have the courage to claim the Guard role in an early speaking position. My judgment of Player 9's identity aligns with my view of Player 3 having a good identity. Let's listen to the speeches of those who haven't spoken yet, especially any werewolf who might pretend to be a Seer to challenge me. If no werewolf claims to be the Seer against me, I will choose to vote for Player 1 to be eliminated.",
