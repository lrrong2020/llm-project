First to speak with no information, suggests the witch should discern if the saved player is a self-stabbing werewolf before revealing identity. Hopes for good speeches from later seers, will cast a valuable vote.\n\n- **Player 8**: Claims villager. States two possibilities for peaceful night: witch used potion or guard protected correctly. Considers Player 7's speech vague, unable to define their identity, possibly good or werewolf. Hopes for good speeches from later seers, will vote based on speeches.\n\n- **Player 9**: Claims guard. Finds Players 7 and 8's speeches vague, unable to define their identities. Will vote based on later seer speeches, will protect seer at night.\n\n- **Player 1**: Claims villager. Believes Player 9 is guard, finds Player 7's speech vague. Comparing 7 and 8's speeches, thinks 7's identity is higher than 8's, states 8 may not necessarily be a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claims villager. Thanks witch and guard for protecting village peace. Believes at least one werewolf among Players 7, 8, and 1. Trusts Player 9 as guard, will vote based on later seer speeches.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims villager. Believes at least two werewolves among Players 7, 8, 1, and 2. Trusts Player 9 as guard, will vote based on later seer speeches.\n\n- **Player 4**: Claims seer, gives Player 3 good identity. Accuses Player 1 of being a werewolf, finding their speech even more vague than 7 and 8's. Trusts Player 9 as guard, will vote for any player pretending to be a seer, if none, votes to eliminate Player 1.\n\n- **Player 5**: Claims villager. Tentatively trusts Player 9 as guard, doesn't believe Players 3 and 4 are both werewolves. Trusts Player 4 as seer, votes to eliminate Player 1 this round.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claims witch, reports Player 7 as saved. Trusts Player 4 as seer, believes three werewolves among villager-claiming Players 7, 8, 1, 2, and 5. Suggests seer check Player 7, votes for Player 1, plans to poison Player 8 at night.\n\n# Subjective Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 7**: Werewolf or Villager\n- **Player 8**: Werewolf or Villager\n- **Player 9**: Guard\n- **Player 1**: Werewolf\n- **Player 2**: Werewolf or Villager\n- **Player 3**: Villager\n- **Player 4**: Seer\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf or Villager\n- **Player 6**: Witch\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 1.",

As I can't define Player 1's specific identity yet, I consider them possibly a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 2**: Claims villager, believes Player 9 is the guard.

I analyze Player 3 as a villager, as Player 4 is the only one claiming seer and gave Player 3 a good identity. Player 4 is the uncontested seer, so their good identity for Player 3 indicates they're good.\n- **Player 4**: Claims seer, reports Player 3 as good identity, thinks Player 1 is a werewolf, believes Player 9 is the guard, wants to vote for Player 1. I analyze Player 4 as the seer, because they're currently the only one claiming this role, so Player 4 is likely the uncontested seer.\n- **Player 5**: Claims villager, believes Player 9 is the guard, thinks Player 4 is the seer, Player 3 is good, wants to vote for Player 1.

Since Player 9 claims to be the Guard, Player 4 claims to be the Seer, and Player 6 claims to be the Witch, the remaining Players 1, 3, and 8 are all villagers, excluding our werewolf teammates. The Guard will definitely choose to protect someone among the special roles tonight, and Player 3 is a villager, so they won't be protected. Now that Player 1, a villager, has been voted out, and the Witch says she will poison Player 8 tonight, who is also a villager. At this point, if we werewolves can eliminate Player 3, we can directly achieve victory by killing all the villagers. Therefore, I need to kill Player 3 tonight.\n\n**Next day's speech strategy**:\n- Continue to pretend to be a good person, use fabricated lies in my speech to confuse and mislead the good people's perspective, and vote against the remaining good players.",
