Player 5 claims to be a special role, but while players 1 and 2 have openly declared their identities, player 5 only focuses on player 4, showing no concern for the statements of players 1 and 2. This is a common mistake made by werewolves - a gap in perspective. Therefore, I also believe that players 4 and 5 are two werewolves who have met. I am a villager. Players 1 and 2 are in high positions claiming special roles, and up until my turn at the bottom, no one has challenged their identities. Given that player 9 stated they are a villager in the first position, then players 1 and 2 must be genuine special roles. The remaining werewolf can only be among players 3, 7, or 9. Player 7 was killed by werewolves on the first night, so we can tentatively consider them a good person. The last werewolf can only be either player 3 or 9. I suggest the Seer check either player 9 or 3 tonight. Tomorrow, if one of them is revealed to be a bad identity, we should vote for that player. If the checked player turns out to be a good identity, we should vote for the other one. I side with player 6 and suggest the Witch poison player 5. I call for a vote against player 4!",

The speaking order is 4, then 6.\n\n- Player 4: Declares player 5 as a good identity. Player 5 claims to be a god role, but players 1 and 2 have already revealed their god roles. Player 5 only focuses on player 4, showing no concern for the statements of players 1 and 2. This is a common mistake made by werewolves - a lack of perspective. Therefore, I judge player 5 to be a werewolf, and consequently, player 4, who declared player 5 as good, is also a werewolf.\n\n- Player 6: Declares player 8 as a good identity. Player 6's speech is well-reasoned and logical, also believing that players 4 and 5 are both werewolves, which aligns with my thoughts. So I believe player 6 is the true seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for player 4.",
