This statement appears to assume that the player competing with 1 is the seer, which means 1 can only be a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Moreover, player 2 claims to be the witch. If 2 were a werewolf, there would be no need to pretend to be the witch, as the real witch would certainly poison a werewolf pretending to be a witch. Therefore, I believe 2 is the real witch, which means player 1, who declared 2 as a bad identity, must be a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be a seer, verifies player 9 as a good identity.

Player 2 claimed to be the witch and said Player 8 was killed but they didn't use the potion.\n- Player 4 declared Player 9 as a good identity.\n- Player 5 also claimed to be the witch, contradicting Player 2, and stated that Player 8 died due to both being protected and saved.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n\nVote for Player 1: Firstly, I am the guard and I protected myself last night. Player 5's statement about Player 8 dying due to \"being both protected and saved\" doesn't align with my information, indicating that Player 5 is a werewolf lying about the information. Therefore, Player 2, who is competing with Player 5 for the witch role, is likely the real witch. Following this logic, we can deduce that Player 1, who declared the real witch (Player 2) as a bad identity, is a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Consequently, Player 4 must be the real seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 1.",
