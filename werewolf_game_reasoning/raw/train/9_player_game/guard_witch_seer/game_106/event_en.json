If the Witch used her healing potion, I suggest she doesn't reveal herself yet. Instead, she should observe the speech of the player she saved to ensure they're truly on the good side. If the Witch decides to reveal herself, she should indicate her potential poisoning target for tonight, making sure it doesn't conflict with the Seer's verification target. If it was the Guard who protected against the werewolves' attack, I suggest the Guard stays hidden today and quietly protects the Seer tonight to ensure the Seer can report their verification results tomorrow. Number 5 claims to be a villager but their speech was vague, so their identity is unclear for now. I hope the Seer in the later speaking positions will make a good speech, and I'll choose which side to support based on that.

Unfortunately, player 6 doesn't dare to pretend to be the Seer against me, so let their werewolf teammate, player 8, pretend to be the Seer right away. There's another possibility: if player 8 also doesn't dare to pretend to be the Seer against me, that would be great. I look forward to the last werewolf in the later speaking positions to pretend to be the Seer against me, which would complete the werewolf lineup. If in this round, the werewolves are intimidated by my strong abilities and none of them dare to pretend to be the Seer against me, then the Guard should protect me tonight, and I will conduct checks as the situation requires.

This proves that Player 7's perspective is not that of a real seer. Player 6 suspects Player 7 might be a werewolf, so Player 6 must have a good identity.

Player 6 deliberately claimed that Player 7 might be a werewolf in their speech, which is clearly putting pressure on Player 7 and undermining their credibility as the Seer. Player 8 attacked Player 7 with the reasoning that if Players 6 and 8 were both werewolves, Player 6 would definitely have claimed to be the Seer and given Player 7 a bad identity. I believe that neither Player 6 nor Player 8 has done anything good, and both have shown strong hostility towards Seer 7. Therefore, I think Players 6 and 8 are both werewolves.

However, 6 suspected 7 of being a werewolf before 7 even spoke. Do you have psychic abilities, Number 6? Moreover, 6 didn't provide any reason for suspecting 7 as a werewolf, so I believe 6 is a werewolf with inside information. In my mind, the werewolf suspects are 6 and 8, and the last werewolf is definitely hiding among the players claiming to be villagers. I suggest Seer 7 check Player 5 tonight, because 5 is the only one giving vague speeches. I think 5 might be a low-key werewolf or a civilian without night actions. Number 9 has commented on the players who spoke before and shares my perspective, so I believe 9 is good. I trust 1's claim as the Guard and 2's claim as the Witch because I know that cowardly werewolves don't have the guts to pretend to be special roles and would only claim to be villagers to survive. I am an unyielding villager and won't fear the werewolves' threats. If you werewolves have the courage, come and kill me tonight. I am the sworn enemy of werewolves!

I don't think Player 1 is the Guard because if they were, they wouldn't have revealed themselves on the first day. The Guard should silently protect the Seer at night. Revealing as the Guard only makes them a target for the werewolves, so Player 1 might be a werewolf pretending to be the Guard. Today, I'll follow Player 7's lead and vote to eliminate Player 8.

Number 7 is the uncontested Seer, who verified that Number 4 is a werewolf. Today, voting out Number 4 is definitely correct. I deeply regret that I was tricked into using my healing potion on Number 8, a werewolf who intentionally wounded himself on the first night. I don't understand what benefit Number 8 gained from this self-inflicted wound on the first night, especially since he didn't pretend to be a seer afterwards. After thinking about it last night, I believe Number 8's only benefit was to conceal his werewolf identity, making it difficult for the good team to identify him as a werewolf. However, coincidentally, Number 8 was verified as a werewolf by the Seer yesterday. Today, I urge all good players to join me in voting for Number 4.",
