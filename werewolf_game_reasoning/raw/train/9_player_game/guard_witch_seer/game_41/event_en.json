No. 1's speech is even more suspicious; based on the logic of No. 8 being the Witch, either No. 1 or No. 9 could be a werewolf. No. 1 stood up claiming that No. 9's speech not attacking them leans towards being good. Although No. 5 was saved by the Witch on the first night, their identity still can't be confirmed.

So, I want to inform the Witch that player 5, whom you saved, is a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive you.\n\nI suspect player 5 will likely pretend to be the Seer immediately because there are only 4 players after me, and it's unlikely for another werewolf to pretend to be the Seer. Player 9, who spoke before me, was brief and didn't attack player 1 much. Player 1 thinks player 9's speech sounds like a good person, mentioning that \"player 9's speech was too polite and didn't directly attack me,\" which might suggest that player 1 and 9 are not face-to-face.\n\nPlayer 2's opinion that players 1 and 9 could be werewolves aligns with a good person's perspective because three players before him have already spoken, player 8 is the Witch, so it's reasonable to suspect players 1 and 9 might include a werewolf. Based on this, I will check player 1 because player 1 thinks player 9 is good, so player 1's identity is more suspicious.\n\nI haven't heard from players 4, 6, and 7 yet, so I can't make further judgments, but my verification target will be updated based on upcoming speeches. For now, I'm planning to check player 1. Briefly arranging the work for the special roles: I hope the Guard can protect me tonight so I can report my verification information tomorrow. The Witch should decide where to use the poison based on her own judgment.\n\nI'm voting for player 5, who I identified as a werewolf. I urge all good people not to split the votes!",

If 8 were a werewolf, claiming to be the witch first would surely get them poisoned by the real witch. Werewolves wouldn't choose such a low-reward action.\n\nLet me evaluate player 3. 3 gave a bad identity to 5, who is the witch's saved player. I personally believe 3 is the real seer for two reasons: First, if 3 were a werewolf knowing who was attacked, they could have given 5 a good identity instead of a bad one, since the witch had already claimed to save 5. Second, if 3 were pretending to be the seer, giving a bad identity to the witch's saved player when 4 players haven't spoken yet is risky. This would only make sense if all the remaining players were their werewolf teammates. But in that case, it would be better to give a good identity to a fellow werewolf and vote for other good players.\n\nSo I believe 3 is the seer, and I won't trust 5 if they suddenly claim to be the seer. Although 3 has a minor issue - they think 1's identity is less trustworthy than 9's and plan to check 1 tonight, I actually think 1's speech is definitely better than 9's. I suggest checking 9 instead.\n\n2's speech reasonably analyzed 1 and 9, so I think 2 has a good player's perspective. Therefore, among the players who haven't spoken yet, besides 5, there's another werewolf. Among those who have spoken, 9 seems like a werewolf.\n\nThis round, I vote for player 5. At night, the witch can poison 6 or 7, whichever you think is more likely to be a werewolf.",

I'm not sure if you killed me at night because you thought I seemed like the Seer, or if Number 8 is your werewolf teammate setting the stage for you. But Number 3, your logic is flawed. You think Number 1 is a werewolf, I'm a werewolf, Numbers 1 and 9 don't know each other, and Number 8 is the Witch. So from your perspective, Numbers 8 and 9 are good people. Shouldn't you then conclude that one werewolf is among Numbers 4, 6, and 7? Yet you say you can't judge these three, which makes me think you're afraid to falsely accuse too many innocent players. Guard, please protect me tonight to ensure I can report Number 9's identity tomorrow. One werewolf is either Number 1 or 9, and the remaining werewolf is either Number 4 or 7. Currently, Number 4's speech quickly sided with Number 3. Tonight, I'll verify Number 9. If Number 9 is innocent, tomorrow we'll have Numbers 1 and 4 face off. I tentatively believe Number 8 is the real Witch. We'll see if Numbers 6 and 7 claim to be the Witch later; if so, we'll reconsider. Assuming Numbers 8 and 3 are both werewolves, it doesn't benefit Number 8 much to claim the Witch role first, and they also declared me as saved, elevating my status. So Number 8 is unlikely to be a werewolf. Today, let's eliminate Number 3. Tomorrow, we'll decide based on my verification, which will likely expose another werewolf. Then my task will be mostly complete, and it'll be up to you to find the last werewolf.",

Moreover, Player 8 in the earlier position claims to be the witch without anyone challenging, so let's temporarily believe that Player 8 is the real witch. In that case, among the remaining Players 1 and 9, there's still another werewolf teammate for Player 3.\n\nI think Player 4 has lowered the credibility of Player 3's seer claim. Player 4 said, \"The witch has already reported Player 5 as her saved target, so Player 3 could have easily given Player 5 a good identity check instead of a bad one.\" This is completely a mistake in speech: If Player 3 is a werewolf, and Players 5, 6, and 7 in the later positions are all unknown identities, how could Player 3 casually give a good identity check? If the good identity check was given to the real seer, wouldn't Player 3 be immediately eliminated? So I believe if Player 3 is a werewolf, then Player 4 is the charge wolf; if Player 3 is the seer, then Player 4 is the reverse-hook wolf!\n\nI'm very hesitant now. First, I'm a good role. Although Player 5 gave me a good identity check, I still don't dare to fully trust that Player 5 is the real seer, because under the premise of believing Player 8 is the witch, Player 5 could very well be a self-stabbing werewolf pretending to be the seer.\n\nAs Player 6, a villager without night actions, I've laid out the logical relationships for everyone.

As a villager, I'm just objectively commenting. I need to point out the illogical parts of your speech, I have to challenge and criticize you. My comments are only about your role card and your speech in this game, nothing personal.\n\nRegarding Player 5's speech, they surprisingly said \"Player 8 is temporarily defined as the real witch.\" If Player 5 is the real seer, assuming Player 8 is a werewolf, what benefit would a werewolf gain by giving the seer a saved player? Therefore, Player 5, as a seer, should definitely believe that \"Player 8 must be the witch.\" So I think Player 5's perspective is problematic. This round, I'm voting for Player 5.",

In my mind, the potential werewolves are Players 2, 5, and 6, which I deduced from yesterday's voting pattern. Let's analyze the speeches from the last round. First, Player 2 attacked Players 9 and 1, claiming that I, Player 9, was trying to protect Player 1's identity and vote for them. If Player 2 thinks I'm \"attacking\" Player 1, how could they possibly believe that both Player 9 and Player 1 are werewolves? Therefore, Player 2 is logically inconsistent and a werewolf eager to protect good players. As for Player 6, I believe they are inconsistent in their words and actions. On the first day, they said they might abstain from voting, but during the vote, they followed Player 5 and voted for Player 3. I think this behavior is typical of a werewolf. So, I suggest we vote out Player 2 this round, and the Witch can poison Player 6 tonight.",

This makes No. 5 sound like a werewolf afraid of revealing their perspective, so I can't believe they're the Seer. For this round's vote, we should first consider No. 3's verification. Additionally, I can suggest that No. 2 and 6 might be werewolves. Firstly, No. 2 and 6 voted with No. 5 against No. 3 in the last round. Secondly, No. 2 attacked both No. 1 and 9 yesterday, and as I'm No. 1, I believe No. 9 is also likely good, so No. 2 seems like a werewolf. No. 6 seems like a werewolf because they attacked No. 4, whom I believe is good. No. 3 can consider my speech, but the final voting decision is yours. I'm just offering my thoughts. If either No. 2 or 6 are good players I've misjudged, don't rush to attack me. First declare yourself as good, then point out the potential werewolf positions.",

I based my judgment of the true and false Seers on the speeches of Players 4, 6, and 7. Player 6 analyzed the possibilities of Players 3 and 5 being the true Seer yesterday, leading me to conclude that Players 5 and 6 haven't met, and regardless of whether Player 3 or 5 is the true Seer, Player 6 is likely a good role. Player 4 supported Player 3, reasoning that \"if Player 3 were a werewolf, knowing Player 8 as the Witch gave Player 5 a silver water, Player 3 would definitely claim Player 5 as a good identity rather than a bad identity.\" I actually think Player 3 might be a werewolf pretending to be a Seer because good players could easily believe Player 3 is the Seer based on Player 4's reasoning. Player 7 directly misrepresented Player 8's statement last round; Player 8 only said Players 4 and 6 might be a werewolf pair, not that they definitely were, as Player 7 claimed. This round, Player 7 was eliminated, and I believe they were poisoned. Given that only Player 7 died last night, it means I, Player 2, was targeted but survived due to self-protection. Last round, Player 5 was the true Seer and was voted out by Players 3, 4, and 7. Today, Player 3, the werewolf pretending to be a Seer, can be eliminated. Player 4 in the outer position is the last werewolf. From my perspective, Player 5 is the true Seer, and Player 6 is truly a good identity. I'm the Guard. The werewolves are only among Players 3, 4, and 7. Player 3 challenged Player 5, the true Seer, because all players in later positions except Players 5 and 6 are Player 3's werewolf teammates. Therefore, I, Player 2, will definitely vote for Player 3 today.",

Based on yesterday's voting, it's clear that players 2, 5, and 6 are the three werewolf cards. The reason I didn't consider player 2 as a werewolf in my previous speech was because, from player 2's position, it was reasonable to suspect players 1 and 9 as werewolves. If player 2 were a villager, there would have been no reason for them to vote for me last round, as my speech was analyzing the situation from their perspective. So, player 2 is likely a werewolf card voting against the seer. This round, player 2 claiming to be the guard is meaningless, and I won't vote for you because player 6 is my bad identity. Moreover, if you were the guard, why didn't you protect player 8, the only witch on the field, instead of siding with me, especially after player 5, whom you sided with, has been eliminated? I don't think player 7 can be a werewolf because I believe the witch wouldn't have poisoned them based on a few words, especially after already choosing the correct side. So, player 7 is likely a villager who was killed, indicating the werewolf team is targeting villagers this round. Currently, the villagers are ahead in terms of rounds, and I'm confident with the witch as the voting leader. I don't think player 2 is the guard, player 7 can't be the guard, and player 9 claimed to be a villager so can't be the guard. Therefore, the guard might be either player 1 in the front or player 4 in the back. I will check player 2 because I don't believe they are the guard. Whether to let player 2 be poisoned depends on the witch's mood. I'm voting for player 6, the werewolf, this round. The witch can lead the vote.",

In their speech, they said, \"If Player 8 says Player 7 was killed by werewolves, then I'll take the place of Player 2 as the Guard and be eliminated.\" The actual situation is indeed that Player 7 was killed by werewolves, so this statement is equivalent to admitting to being a werewolf.
