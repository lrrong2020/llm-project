Speech starts from No.8.\n\n# Speech and Behavior Analysis\n- **Player 8**: Witch. No.5 is the first day's silver water. Hopes the Guard hides their identity. If No.5 claims to be the Seer, won't side with them just because they're silver water. Believes one werewolf is among No.1 and No.9. No.4 and No.6 might be two werewolves. One werewolf might be among No.2, No.3, and No.7.\n  - Subjective analysis: True Witch.\n  \n- **Player 9**: Villager. Will decide whether to attack No.1 after hearing their speech.\n  - Subjective analysis: Speech contradicts by saying \"neither agree nor disagree\" with No.8. The statement about \"whether to attack No.1\" sounds like a werewolf looking for a scapegoat.\n  \n- **Player 1**: Thinks No.9 didn't attack them, seems like a good role. Believes No.8 is the true Witch. No.5's identity unknown. Waiting for the Seer's speech.\n  - Subjective analysis: Considers No.9 as good, so No.1's identity is lower than No.9's.\n  \n- **Player 2**: No.8 is Witch. Based on No.8's logic, one werewolf is among No.1 and No.9. No.5's identity unknown. No.2 is not the Seer. Hints at being the Guard.\n  - Subjective analysis: Siding with werewolf teammates.\n  \n- **Player 3**: Seer. No.5 is bad identity. Believes No.8 is the true Witch. Thinks No.1's identity is lower than No.9's, No.2's identity fits a good perspective. Will check No.1 tonight. Can't judge No.4, No.6, and No.7 who haven't spoken yet. Votes for No.5 as bad identity.\n  - Subjective analysis: Speech is fair, perspective correct, just mistakenly mentioned No.12 instead of No.9, probably a slip-up.\n  \n- **Player 4**: Good role. No.8 is Witch. Believes No.3 is the true Seer, thinks No.1's speech is better than No.9's. Considers No.2 as good. Votes for No.5, suggests Witch poison No.6 or No.7.\n  - Subjective analysis: If No.3 is the true Seer, No.5 is a werewolf. One werewolf among No.1 and No.9. One werewolf among No.4, No.6, and No.7. If No.3 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, then two werewolves among No.4, No.6, and No.7. No.4 considers No.2 as good, so No.4's identity is lower than No.2's.\n  \n- **Player 5**: Seer. No.6 is good identity. Thinks No.3's judgment that No.1's identity is lower than No.2's has no basis. Or No.1 is No.3's werewolf teammate. Votes for No.3.\n  - Subjective analysis: If No.5 is the true Seer, No.6 is good identity. No.3 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer challenging the true Seer. Then at least one of No.4 or No.7 is No.3's werewolf teammate. If No.5 is a werewolf, giving No.6 good identity, No.6's identity still can't be determined. Probably No.5 and No.6 are not on the same side.\n    \n- **Player 6**: No.3 and No.4 might be two werewolves. No.5, No.6, and No.7 are all white cards in No.3's eyes. Thinks No.4's logic collapses when saying if No.3 is a werewolf, knowing No.8 Witch gave No.5 silver water, would give No.5 good identity instead of bad identity. Considers No.4 as a public werewolf position. Might abstain from voting.\n  - Subjective analysis: Speech analysis similar to mine.\n\n- **Player 7**: Thinks No.8 pointed out four werewolf cards. Votes for No.5, siding with No.3.\n  - Subjective analysis: Misrepresents No.8's speech, No.8 only said No.4 and No.6 might be two werewolves, not definitely.\n\n# True Identity Guess\n- **No.1**: Villager\n- **No.2**: Werewolf (self)\n- **No.3**: Seer\n- **No.4**: Villager\n- **No.5**: Werewolf (teammate)\n- **No.6**: Werewolf (teammate)\n- **No.7**: Villager\n- **No.8**: Witch\n- **No.9**: Villager",
