This indicates player 4 must have seen either player 3 or 8 last night, which means player 4 must have the perspective of a werewolf. Although player 4 is pretending to be a seer, most of their speech is lies. However, I believe there's one thing player 4 didn't lie about: that among the eliminated players 3 and 8, there should be a witch and a werewolf. Player 5, although you're siding with player 4, there's no room for you in the werewolf camp. I hope you can change your mind in time.

I choose to support Player 1 as the Seer and vote for Player 2, who was identified as a werewolf by Player 1. Firstly, I believe Player 4 is pretending to be the Seer. Player 6 has already explained the reasons. Player 4 thinks Players 3 and 8 are a werewolf and a witch, but only a werewolf would know their teammate's identity for certain. It's likely that either Player 3 or 8 is Player 4's werewolf teammate, making Players 2 and 4 the remaining werewolves. Alternatively, if neither Player 3 nor 8 is Player 4's teammate and Player 4 is just confusing the villagers, I think Player 5 is most likely to be a werewolf. This is because Player 5 immediately sided with Player 4 after being declared a good identity by them. So Player 5 could be either a villager or a werewolf. If Player 5 is a villager, I hope they reconsider their position. Additionally, I'll explain why Player 2 is definitely a werewolf: after being identified as a werewolf by Player 1, Player 2 gave a vague speech without countering Player 1's claim, only saying Player 1 is a werewolf without elaborating. I think Player 2 seems like a werewolf who has given up struggling. In conclusion, I believe Player 1 is the Seer, Player 2 is a werewolf, Player 4 is pretending to be the Seer, Player 5 is either a villager or a werewolf, and either Player 3 or 8 is the Witch. Player 7, the Guard, will vote for Player 2. I hope everyone votes bravely.",

Player 4 mentioned in their speech that they think there's a witch and a werewolf among players 3 and 8. Player 4's statement wasn't a guess about the identities of 3 and 8, but rather a precise identification. Only a werewolf could know their teammate's identity for certain, so it's likely that one of 3 or 8 is player 4's werewolf teammate. No witch has come forward yet, so the witch was probably killed last night. Therefore, I think one of 3 or 8 might be the witch who was killed. Moreover, I suspect player 2 is a werewolf because after being identified as a bad identity by player 1, player 2's defense was unsatisfactory. They didn't counter-attack player 1, only saying player 1 is a werewolf without elaborating. So I think player 2 seems like a werewolf who has given up struggling. I will vote for player 2 to be lynched today.",
