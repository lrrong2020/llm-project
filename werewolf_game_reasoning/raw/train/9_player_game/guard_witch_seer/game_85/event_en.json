Today, I'm declaring myself as the witch and strongly calling for votes. I demand all good players to vote with me for Player 8.

Number 5 said in their speech this round, \"If I'm attacked tonight, the Witch doesn't need to save me and can directly poison Number 2.\" Your subconscious speech implies that the Witch still has the healing potion. Given this, how could you possibly accept Number 3's speech? There's only one explanation: you, Number 3, and Number 5 are both werewolves. I side with Seer Number 2.

Let's first look at players 2 and 5, who both claim to be the seer. They both gave bad identities to later-position players and discussed only known public information. Player 5 did slightly better by briefly analyzing the situation and suggesting that players 7 and 8 might be werewolves. Now, looking at players 3 and 6, who both claim to be the guard in response to being identified as bad: Player 3 explained why they protected player 9 and dared to attack the earlier-position player 8. Player 6 didn't explain their thought process for guarding and argued that player 5 shouldn't have accepted player 3, but player 5 never said player 3 was definitely good. Moreover, I think it's reasonable for player 5 to accept player 3 after already finding two werewolves. Player 6 is purely forcing their argument. In conclusion, I believe players 3 and 5 are on the good team, with player 5 being the seer and player 3 the guard. Players 2 and 6 are werewolves. I also think player 1 is very likely a werewolf! I don't believe player 1 is the witch; I think there's over an 80% chance that player 1 is a werewolf! This round, I vote for player 6.",

Didn't show a Seer's perspective or a broad view of the game. Therefore, I don't think player 2 is likely to be the Seer.\n- **Player 5**: Gave player 6 a bad identity, mentioned all players in their speech, and advised the Guard not to forcefully protect themselves but to play mind games with the werewolves. This shows they're thinking for the good team, so I believe player 5 is most likely the Seer.\n- **Player 3**: Claimed to be the Guard after receiving a bad identity. Their speech didn't contain much information, so it's not very helpful.\n- **Player 6**: Claimed to be the Guard after receiving a bad identity. In their speech, player 6 criticized player 5 for accepting player 3's claim based on their speech. However, from player 5's perspective, they've already identified two werewolves, and player 3 was given a bad identity by a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. So it makes sense for player 5 to accept player 3. Player 6's forceful attack on player 5 leads me to believe that player 6 is a werewolf trying to protect the real Guard, player 3.\n- In conclusion, I believe players 2 and 6 are werewolves, player 5 is the Seer, and player 3 is the Guard.\n\nSince player 5, who I believe is the Seer, is voting for player 6, I think voting for player 6 is the best choice this round.",

However, Player 7 abruptly suggested that I'm likely a werewolf, which doesn't align with a typical good player's perspective.\n\nAssuming I'm not the witch, there definitely won't be a double death tomorrow, as no one else has claimed to be the witch. In that case, if I'm not the witch, the real witch could only be the deceased Player 9. If Player 7 were a good player doubting my identity, they should wait to see tomorrow's death results before concluding about my role, rather than suspecting me as a werewolf today when I'm the only witch claim. Such a statement could easily make the real witch suspicious and potentially use the poison on them.\n\nBased on these points, I believe Player 7 is a werewolf, and I've decided to vote for Player 7.",

Player 6 claims to be a guard but doesn't explain their thought process for guarding. As a later-position player accused of being a werewolf, they didn't explain why they chose to protect player 9 on the first night and failed to present a comprehensive logic. I believe player 6 is a werewolf and player 5 is the seer. However, hastily voting from the players claiming to be guards might risk eliminating the true guard, putting the good team at a disadvantage. Therefore, I will vote from the players claiming to be seers, namely between players 2 and 5. I believe player 2 is a werewolf and player 5 is the seer, so I will vote for player 2 to be eliminated this round.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 5 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for player 2.",
