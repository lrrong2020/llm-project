However, we can't determine the identities of players 7 and 8.\n- Player 4 said, \"What if player 7 was the Seer?\" In this statement, player 4 ignored player 8, who also died last night. This suggests that player 4 assumes player 8 couldn't be the Seer. A villager wouldn't have such a clear definition of roles. Therefore, I believe players 4 and 8 are werewolves who met during the night, so player 4 knows that player 8 was a werewolf who sacrificed themselves and not the Seer.\n- Player 6 expressed agreement with player 4's viewpoint.

Therefore, I think player 2 is forcefully attacking players 1 and 9, making player 2 suspicious of being a werewolf. Since player 5 attacked player 4, and player 6 agreed with player 4's viewpoint, player 5's action of voting for player 4 while skipping player 6 is not good, making player 5 suspicious of being a werewolf. This round, I'm only commenting on players 2 and 5. I consider players 2 and 5 to be suspicious werewolves, and I won't evaluate any other players this round!

Player 4 might be player 8's werewolf teammate, confirming identities at night, which is why they implicitly assumed during the day that their self-sacrificing werewolf companion, player 8, isn't the seer. Therefore, player 7 is likely the real seer. Based on the assumption that player 4 is a werewolf, and player 6 agreed with player 4's logic, I believe players 4 and 6 are a werewolf pair. My priority in voting for player 4 yesterday wasn't to bypass player 6, but because I first identified player 4 as a werewolf through their speech, which then led to my suspicion of player 6 also being a werewolf. Player 4 essentially formed the logical basis for my werewolf-hunting strategy. Hence, I naturally chose to prioritize voting for player 4. Moreover, player 3 declared yesterday that they are the witch and didn't use the healing potion.
