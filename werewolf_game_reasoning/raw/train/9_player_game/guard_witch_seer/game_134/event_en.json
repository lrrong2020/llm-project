This speaking order is not necessarily a bad thing for me, as I can observe all players' speeches and finally analyze who I believe to be the werewolves. Player 6's speech was brief, without providing useful information, possibly a werewolf trying to lay low or a civilian with no night role. Player 7 giving Player 4 a bad identity suggests that 7 might be attempting to challenge the Seer in a later position, but unfortunately, 7 mistakenly identified the Guard as a werewolf. Although Player 9's speech was short, they commented on the previous speakers and mentioned Player 8 who was eliminated during the night, showing a good person's perspective, so I believe 9 is innocent. Player 1's speech was incisive, discussing the possibility that 7 is not the Seer. I think Player 1 has given this considerable thought and also has a good person's perspective, so I believe 1 is innocent. Even though Player 2 claims to be the Guard, I don't believe it because Player 7, who I think is pretending to be the Seer, gave a bad identity to Player 4 who claimed to be the Guard. In my view, 4 must be the real Guard, and 2 is a werewolf pretending to be the Guard. Although Player 3 didn't explicitly claim to be the Witch, I can sense from their words that they are implying this role. I believe that with Player 3's intelligence, after hearing my speech, they will surely side with me. This round, I ask all the good people to join me in voting out Player 7, the werewolf. During the night, I hope the Witch will poison Player 2, and I will verify Player 6 tonight.",

Player 7 didn't explain their thought process for checking player 4, nor did they indicate their checking target for tonight. Therefore, I believe player 7 doesn't have a seer's perspective and is likely a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n- **Player 5**: Gave player 7 a bad identity. I think player 5's speech is logical and quick-witted. Their judgment of other players' identities aligns with my own assessment of most players. Moreover, player 5 considers me, player 9, as good. Therefore, I believe player 5 is the real seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 5 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Assessment of Other Players Based on the Seer's Judgment:\n- **Player 7**: Is a werewolf competing against player 5 for the seer role.\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 7.",

Player 7 didn't explain their thought process for checking player 4, and they said player 6's speech was vague, considering player 6 might be a villager or a werewolf. However, player 7 didn't choose to check player 6, instead asking for input from good players in later positions. Therefore, I believe player 7 doesn't have a seer's perspective.\n\n- Player 5: Declares player 7 as bad identity. If player 5 were a werewolf, giving a bad identity to player 7, who has already claimed to be a seer in an earlier position, would have little persuasive power.
