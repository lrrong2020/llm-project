Player 8's analysis claiming that if Player 7 were a werewolf, giving a good identity to an eliminated player would have no benefit, is a false logic statement. Werewolves could deliberately do this to make the villagers think such a move has no benefit for werewolves, thus believing the person making such a statement must be a villager. In this case, \"giving a good identity to an eliminated player\" changes from having no benefit to being beneficial for werewolves. Moreover, Player 7 giving a good identity to Player 4, who is already eliminated, has no credibility. I believe this is precisely a werewolf intentionally hiding their perspective. Furthermore, why would Player 8 immediately side with Player 7? What are the odds of Player 6, speaking first, directly giving a bad identity to a real seer? Have you calculated that? In conclusion, Player 8 is definitely a blatant werewolf charging forward to protect Player 7. I will vote for Player 7 today and suggest the guard protect Player 6 tonight.",

Analyzing two possibilities: If Player 7 is a werewolf, after receiving Player 6's bad identity claim, choosing to give a bad identity to a later-speaking player would be more convincing than giving a good identity to Player 4. Moreover, if the werewolf team has decided to give a good identity to an eliminated player, it would be more beneficial for Player 7's werewolf teammate to pretend to be a seer, while Player 7 pretends to be a guard or witch, identifying the remaining special roles on the field. If Player 6 is a werewolf, Player 6 pretending to be a seer could give a bad identity to Player 7 as the real seer. Based on position analysis, either Player 2 or 5 is a werewolf, and either Player 8 or 9 is a werewolf. I haven't heard Player 5 speak yet. Player 8 supports Player 7 but didn't analyze why Player 6 might be a werewolf. I think Player 8 might be a werewolf who opens their eyes at night and blindly supports Player 7 during the day. Player 9, although analyzing the probability of werewolves challenging the real seer, didn't consider that if Player 6 is pretending to be a seer, they could accurately give a bad identity to Player 7 as the real seer, and Player 6's werewolf teammates might not have been eliminated yet. So I believe Player 9 and Player 2, who follows Player 9's logic, are both using one-sided reasoning. I think Players 1 and 4 are likely good and one of them might be the witch. I believe Player 7 is likely the real seer, Player 6 is pretending to be a seer, Players 8 and 9 could be werewolves or villagers, and Players 2 and 5 could be werewolves or villagers.

Why would you label someone as a werewolf just for siding with player 6? Don't you think that if player 6 were a werewolf, how could they so accurately give a bad identity to player 7, whom you consider to be the Seer? Haven't you considered the possibility that player 6 might actually be the Seer? Therefore, players 7 and 8 are both werewolves. Player 6 is the real Seer! Player 3's speech didn't even consider this basic logic, and still chose to softly side with player 7, so player 3 is also a werewolf! This round, I vote for player 7.",
