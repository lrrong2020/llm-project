Since Players 7 and 8 are a pair of werewolves, Player 7 was able to confidently throw out a bad identity earlier, hoping to challenge the real Seer. While Player 8 seemed to be analyzing the situation when speaking, they actually didn't provide any valuable logical output, and their speech was completely meaningless. Player 8 was clearly stalling during their speech to hide their werewolf identity, and will definitely help Player 7, who is pretending to be the Seer, during the voting! I believe Player 2 is the Witch and Player 6 is the Guard. With all the special role players having revealed themselves, Player 4's speech was only five words long. I think there's a 50% chance that Player 4 is a werewolf who's laying low. Tonight, I will check Player 4! Today, please follow me and vote unanimously to eliminate Player 8, the bad identity I found. Witch, please use your poison on Player 7 tonight, and Guard, please protect me.

I chose Player 2 simply because they were close, and I didn't want them to be eliminated. Now, Player 2, you claim to be the Witch, so you should use your poison tonight because you'll certainly die tomorrow. Player 6 is a werewolf who immediately pretended to be the Guard, interrupting my speech. I must say the coordination between Player 6 and Player 7 is quite impressive. Player 7, also a werewolf, gave me a bad identity check, while Player 6 in the front position directly claimed to be the Guard. I believe the players in later positions have some ability to discern the truth. This round, we should vote for Player 7. To prove whether I'm the Guard or not, just see if Player 2 dies tomorrow. If Player 2 doesn't die tomorrow, I'll voluntarily leave the game. If Player 2 dies, doesn't that indirectly prove that I'm the Guard? Last night, Player 9, the Seer, checked Player 8 and found them to be a werewolf. So now we have Players 6, 7, and 8 as our three werewolves. Today, let's vote for Player 7, the werewolf. Good guys, don't split your votes!",

The speaking order is 7, then 9.\n\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 1 as bad identity. Since player 6 in the early position claimed to be the guard, saying \"I'm the guard, witch number 2 can rest assured,\" which sounds good and doesn't seem like a werewolf. Also, player 7's statement \"Two god cards have already been revealed in the early positions, so tonight guard number 6 should protect witch number 2\" aligns with a normal seer's perspective.\n\n- **Player 9**: Declares player 8 as bad identity. Player 8's speech showed no werewolf behavior, and player 1 in the last position claimed to be the guard, saying \"If player 2 doesn't die tomorrow, I'll automatically be out.\" I believe this kind of statement is deliberately made by a werewolf to avoid being voted out, so I think player 1 is a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for player 1.",
