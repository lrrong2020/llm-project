I'm the Seer, and I checked No. 8 last night, revealing a bad identity! I'm addressing all the good players: do you know why the two werewolves, No. 2 and No. 8, consecutively pretended to be Seers and claimed No. 4 as a bad identity? It's obvious that the werewolves want to vote out No. 4, the Witch, on the first day! The actions of No. 2 and No. 8 are so malicious and ruthless!\n\nNow, I have to tell everyone some bad news. My speaking position is very awkward. As the Seer speaking last, I really can't convince everyone with the strength of my verification. This is heaven's natural injustice to me! If you don't believe me, I'm willing to be voted out along with the two iron werewolves, No. 2 and No. 8! However, as the Seer, I have one request: I only allow the good players to vote among No. 1, No. 2, and No. 8. If you're acting for the good side, please don't vote for No. 4, the Witch. Otherwise, if the Witch is eliminated, we good players will immediately collapse! I'm willing to bear the judgment of exile instead of the Witch, but please keep the Witch alive. Let the Witch and the werewolf pretending to be the Witch resolve their issues during the night! If you're willing to believe me, please don't split your votes. Vote unanimously to eliminate No. 8, the bad identity. I can proudly tell you: I don't need to use my verification ability tonight!",

The speaking order is 2, 8, 1.\n- **Player 2**: Declared player 4 as bad identity.\n- **Player 8**: Declared player 4 as bad identity.\n- **Player 1**: Declared player 8 as bad identity.\n- I don't believe player 2 is the real seer because they didn't consider the possibility of a werewolf pretending to be a seer in the later positions, nor did they indicate how they would verify tonight.\n- If player 1 were pretending to be a seer, one of the two players (2 or 8) claiming to be seers before them must be their werewolf teammate, and both declared player 4 as bad identity. Therefore, player 1 wouldn't need to claim seer. Moreover, since both 2 and 8 declared player 4 as bad identity, we can assume they are allied, trying to vote out player 4 as the witch. Thus, I believe player 1, the third to claim seer, is more likely to be the real seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 1 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against players 1 and 8.\n- **Player 8**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against players 1 and 2, also the werewolf identified by seer player 1.\n- **Player 4**: The real witch.\n- **Player 6**: A werewolf pretending to be the witch.\n- Since I side with player 1 as the real seer, I should vote for player 8, who was identified as a werewolf by player 1.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 8.",

            "reason": "Even on the second day of the game, I still stand by my judgment from the previous round: Player 1 is the Seer, and Player 4 is the true Witch.\n\nAs I'm aware of my role as the Guard:\n- I'm the Guard, and I protected Player 4 last night. Players 4 and 6 both claimed to be the Witch. If Player 6 were the real Witch, they would have certainly poisoned Player 4. However, Player 4 is still alive while Player 6 was eliminated, which means Player 6 was a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and Player 4 is the true Witch.\n- Players 2 and 8, who accused Player 4 (the Witch) of being a werewolf, must be werewolves pretending to be the Seer.\n- Moreover, Player 2 accused Player 3 (me, the Guard) of being a werewolf, which confirms that Player 2 is definitely a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n\nBased on the assumption that Player 1 is the Seer, here's my assessment of other players' identities:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf competing with Player 1 for the Seer role.\n\nConsidering all of this, I've decided to vote for Player 2.",
