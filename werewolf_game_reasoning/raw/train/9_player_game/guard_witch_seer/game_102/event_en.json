I think Players 3 and 4 are likely two werewolves trying to vote out the Witch! I implore the Guard to protect me tonight so I can report at least one more night's verification. This round, I'm voting for any werewolf in a later position who pretends to be the Seer. If no werewolf in a later position does so, I'll vote for Player 4!

I find this claim to be very convincing, unless Players 5 and 6 are both werewolves working together to establish false identities. However, I can see my own card, and Player 6 is indeed a good person. It's possible that Player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer and making a bold move by identifying Player 6 as good, but I believe there's a high probability that Player 5 is the real Seer.\n\nPlayer 2 was the first to claim the Witch role, stating they saved Player 9 on the first night. I think Player 2 is likely the real Witch. Player 3 attacked Player 2 based solely on the fact that they were the first to claim the Witch role, which makes me suspect Player 3 is a werewolf. Player 4 defended Player 3 as a good person without any reasoning, which suggests Player 4's role is inferior to Player 3's, and Player 4 is also likely a werewolf.\n\nTherefore, from my perspective, if no one in the later positions claims to be the Seer, I will definitely vote for Player 4. If someone in a later position does claim to be the Seer, I will choose sides based on the logic of their speech. I hope that any player in a later position who wants to claim the Seer role will speak carefully. Given that Player 5 has already identified a good person, I'm putting pressure on anyone in a later position who wants to claim the Seer role. I will have zero tolerance for any flaws in your speech.\n\nFor now, I'm not sure who I'll vote for. I'll wait to hear the speeches from the remaining players.",

My reasoning for checking Number 8 was to verify someone nearby, as identifying a good identity could help me gather votes, while finding a bad identity would allow for immediate elimination. I believe Number 2 is the true Witch. Last night was peaceful, so the Witch still has the poison. There's no benefit for a werewolf in the first position to pretend to be the Witch, as they could easily be poisoned by the real Witch. Number 9's saved identity is currently undefined; let's observe their speech and voting today. Number 3 claims to be a villager but immediately attacks Number 2, the Witch. Shouldn't the Witch have reported saving someone on a peaceful night? Number 2, the Witch, believes Number 9 is likely not a self-harming werewolf and is probably good, which I find reasonable. Number 3, please be clear about your role. If you're not the Witch, don't engage with the Witch. If you're good, I hope you'll think carefully and vote wisely. I think Number 4 is likely a werewolf following others' lead, immediately considering Number 3 as good and using faulty logic to attack Number 2, the Witch. They suggest Number 2 saved Number 9, who might claim to be the Seer. Thus, I believe Number 4 is a teammate of Number 5, who is pretending to be the Seer. Number 5's speech reveals no thought process for checking Number 6, stating that as the Seer, they can check anyone they want. This exposes their werewolf identity. Real Seers have logic behind their checks. Your speech tells me you're a werewolf checking based on the daytime speaking order, so I believe Number 6 is likely good. Tonight, the Guard can protect me while I check Number 4's identity. As the Seer, my duty is to find and eliminate werewolves through verification, leading the good team to victory.

This claim is very convincing, making No.5 highly likely to be the real Seer.\n- **Player No.7**: Declares No.8 as good identity. The claim is somewhat convincing, so No.7 could possibly be the Seer.\n- **Player No.9**: Declares No.3 as bad identity. If No.3 is indeed a werewolf, then the werewolf distribution doesn't match my earlier judgment that \"three out of four Seer claimants are werewolves\". Therefore, I believe No.9 is not the Seer but a werewolf.\n- **Player No.1**: Declares No.5 as bad identity. No.1's speech lacks details about the verification process and is brief, making it less credible. No.1 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe the Seer is either No.5 or No.7. No.9 and No.1 are werewolves. We should vote to eliminate one of them during the day and use the witch's poison on the other at night.\n\n# In conclusion, I think voting for No.9 as the werewolf is the better choice this round.",

Therefore, player 9, being the third to claim seer, is likely a werewolf teammate of player 7, supporting 7's claim. Moreover, player 9 gave player 3 a bad identity but didn't suggest voting for 3, instead voting for 5. If 9 were a real seer, they would prioritize voting for the werewolf they identified. This strongly indicates that player 9 is a werewolf.\n- Players 1 and 7 are likely werewolf teammates of player 9.\n# Werewolf Probability Ranking:\n- 9 > 1 = 7 > 5\nTherefore, I judge that player 9 is definitely a werewolf, and player 5 is most likely the real seer.

If Player 9 were my werewolf teammate, and we were both werewolves, we could have easily voted together for Player 5, the real Seer. Therefore, Player 9 cannot be my (Player 7's) werewolf teammate. Player 1's speech is typical of a werewolf jumping in at the last position to cause confusion. Player 1's speech ultimately doesn't fit the Seer's role. Player 1 giving Player 5 a bad identity directly elevates Player 5's status. They think Player 9 giving Player 3 a bad identity and calling for votes on Player 5 as a werewolf teammate is already a mistake in their speech, so they jumped in to take the fall for their werewolf teammate, Player 9. Last night, Player 5, as a werewolf, tried to elevate their Seer status again by attempting to kill one werewolf during the night to defraud the witch's potion. I can only say that the good team shouldn't be blinded. Today, vote Player 5 out. Tonight, I can lead the poisoning. We've identified all three werewolves. My mission as the Seer is complete.

From yesterday's speeches, we can see that players 1, 7, and 9 all voted for player 5, so I deduce that players 1, 7, and 9 are on the same side and all oppose player 5. The priority to vote for player 9 is because they gave player 3 a bad identity check, yet didn't vote for their own bad identity card 3, but instead voted for player 5. Moreover, among the four players claiming to be the seer, three are werewolves, so player 3 in the outer position can't be a werewolf. Therefore, player 9's bad identity check on player 3 must be fake, so I'm voting for player 9. Today, we can eliminate either player 1 or 7, depending on player 5's preference. Whoever you choose to vote for, I'll follow your lead. I believe players 1 and 7 are the last two werewolves on the field. But why didn't the witch, player 2, directly poison a werewolf last night? I hope the witch doesn't make a mistake. The situation on the field is very clear now, please use your poison tonight.",

Therefore, we can't assume that Player 5 is definitely a seer who was attacked just because the night was peaceful when Player 5 was protected.\n\nYesterday, Players 5, 7, 9, and 1 all claimed to be seers. Excluding the possibility of good players causing confusion, we're left with three werewolves and one seer. Player 9 gave me a bad identity, so they must be a werewolf. The good team is also strong, as they've clearly identified Player 9 as a werewolf.\n\nI'm a villager, and I don't understand why the witch chose to hold onto the poison. Using it randomly would have a higher chance of poisoning a werewolf than the seer. As for today's situation with Players 1, 5, and 7 - who is the real seer and who is pretending to be one - I believe the good team doesn't need to carefully distinguish between them. Since a werewolf was eliminated yesterday, the good team has a significant advantage.
