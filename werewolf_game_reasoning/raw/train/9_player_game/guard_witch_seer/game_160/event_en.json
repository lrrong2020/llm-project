I've confirmed my own identity as a villager, so among these four players claiming to be villagers, there's a high probability that two of them are werewolves. I find number 8 particularly suspicious. Number 8 claimed that player 5 committed a \"heinous crime\" and suggested that someone in the later positions would pretend to be a seer to exonerate him. I think number 8's speech is very contrived, repeatedly emphasizing his innocence, which actually makes him sound more like a werewolf who has been identified by the seer and is now flustered and incoherent. In my opinion, number 8 is just a smooth-talking little werewolf. Number 1 claimed to be the guard, and number 2 claimed to be the witch. Since no one challenged their role claims, I'll tentatively believe that number 1 is the guard and number 2 is the witch. I have a strong feeling that number 4, in the last position, is likely to claim to be the seer. I'll wait to hear number 4's speech before deciding which side to support.",

Player 8 mentioned that a seer in a later position would save him. I believe player 8 is passing a message to his werewolf teammate in a later position, encouraging them to pretend to be a seer to save him. Moreover, I think player 8's immediate acceptance of players 6 and 7 as good people is too hasty. In my view, players 6 and 7 could also be passive werewolves. Therefore, I believe player 8 is a werewolf deliberately acting to gain the trust of good people. Consequently, player 5, who gave player 8 a bad identity, is likely the real seer.\n\n- **Player 4**: Gave player 5 a bad identity. Player 4's check on player 5, who has already spoken in the first position, carries much less weight than player 5's check. Furthermore, based on my analysis of player 5's identity above, player 4 is likely a werewolf pretending to be a seer in opposition to player 5.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 5 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 4**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer in opposition to player 5.\n- **Player 8**: The bad identity checked by seer player 5.\n\n# What I should do now:\n- **Vote for player 8**: Since player 8 is the bad identity checked by seer player 5, and player 5 has called for votes against player 8, as a good person, I should prioritize following the seer's lead to eliminate the werewolf they've identified.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 8.",

I believe player 4 giving a bad identity to player 5, who has already claimed to be a seer, is an attempt to vote for player 5.
