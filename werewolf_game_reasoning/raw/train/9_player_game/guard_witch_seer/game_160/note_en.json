I analyze that player 7 is likely to be player 5's werewolf teammate, so I decide to verify player 7's identity.\n\n**Next day's speech strategy**:\n- Through sincere speech, I will try to persuade the good players on the field to believe in my seer identity, and lead them to exile the werewolves.",
