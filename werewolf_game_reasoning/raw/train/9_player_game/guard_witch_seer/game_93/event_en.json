Or did you kill one of them at night, so you know who the Witch is, and you don't want to reveal that you're a Werewolf, so you're pushing player 3 as a scapegoat? I think player 3's speech is much better than player 2's. At least player 3 has their own logical reasoning, correctly recognizing the identities of players 1 and 6. Even if player 3's analysis is flawed, they still appear more innocent than you, player 2. So I believe player 3 is a good guy. I can't comment on the players in later positions who haven't spoken yet, but I hope they speak well. If no one in the later positions claims to be the Seer, I will vote for player 2 to be eliminated this round! However, if the Seer reports a bad identity, I might not vote for player 2.

Initially, my rationality overcame my impulse, but then I carefully considered that Player 1 was attacked, I'm Player 5, and 1 plus 5 equals 6. In the end, impulse triumphed over reason, and I poisoned Player 6. Player 2, in the front position, spoke briefly, possibly a werewolf or a villager. Player 3 analyzed the situation carefully, so I believe Player 3 is good. Player 4 claimed to be the Guard and also analyzed from a good person's perspective, so I trust that Player 4 is indeed the Guard.

If Player 9 had been a good identity, I would have focused on Player 8's speech in the middle and put some pressure on them. Since Player 9 is a bad identity, we should directly vote them out. I believe Player 4 is the real Guard, and Player 5 might be the real Witch, or possibly a werewolf pretending to be the Witch to trick the Guard into protecting Player 5, thus allowing them to kill me or the Guard. Personally, I think it's disadvantageous for the good team if the Witch uses the poison on the first night, as the probability of poisoning a good player is higher than poisoning a werewolf when there's no information or logical basis. Both Player 4 (Guard) and Player 5 (suspected Witch) who spoke earlier believe Player 3 is good and Player 2's speech was not convincing. Therefore, I will likely verify Player 2's identity this round. This round, the good team should vote with me against Player 9, the werewolf. As for whether to protect Player 5 tonight, I'll leave that decision to Player 4, the Guard, to analyze.",

What's there to question about the double death of Players 1 and 6? It's simply that one was killed by werewolves and the other was poisoned by the Witch. So I believe Player 2 is a werewolf. From what I've heard from the players who spoke before me, Players 3 and 4 both seem to be good. Therefore, Player 3 must be a villager like me, and Player 4 is the real Guard. The issue lies with Player 5. I'm not sure if Player 5 is the real Witch or a werewolf. In any case, I side with Player 7 and vote to eliminate Player 9. Tonight, we can check Player 5. If Player 5 turns out to be good, then we can directly lynch Player 2 tomorrow. For this round, I'm calling for everyone to vote for Player 9's elimination.

My reasoning for checking Player 1 was to verify someone nearby, as identifying a good player could help me gather votes, while finding a bad one would allow for immediate elimination. Player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer and accurately targeted the real Seer. I believe Player 3 is good. Player 7, in their speech, expressed suspicion about Player 2 being either a villager or a werewolf, suggesting that Player 2 is actually a good player that Player 7, as a werewolf, is trying to frame. Player 4 is the real Guard, and Player 5 is likely the real Witch. The Guard should protect the Witch tonight to ensure a peaceful night, while the Witch should save anyone except Player 8.\n\nFirst, let me explain why I'm definitely the real Seer: If I were a werewolf, there would be no need for me to speak last and declare Player 1, who was targeted last night, as good. Since I indeed checked Player 1 last night, and Player 5 accurately reported that Player 1 was the target, I believe Player 5 is the real Witch, and Player 6 is likely a werewolf. I think Player 8 is an aggressive werewolf, as their speech lacks logic, blindly siding with Player 7, claiming to be a villager, and suspecting Player 5, the real Witch. These actions are enough to prove that Player 8 is not a genuine villager.\n\nPlayer 7, as a werewolf, accurately declared me, Player 9, as the Seer to be eliminated, knowing there were only two roles left and one was their werewolf teammate. Good players, please vote with me against Player 7 today. Tonight, I will check Player 8's identity. Although I've expressed my belief that Player 8 is a werewolf, as the Seer, I still need to confirm their identity through verification. The Seer's purpose is to identify werewolves and lead the good team to victory!",

The reasons are as follows:\n\n- **Player 7**: Declared Player 9 as a bad identity. Although Player 9's immediate claim to be the Seer seems like a forced move by a werewolf, Player 7 spoke third from last. It's highly possible that after realizing Player 8 is their fellow werewolf, they precisely gave a bad identity to Player 9, the real Seer.\n\n- **Player 9**: Declared Player 1 as a good identity. Player 1 is already eliminated from the game. Player 9's declaration of Player 1 as a good identity doesn't carry much weight. It could be a werewolf forced to claim the Seer role in the last position, trying to gain the trust of good players by declaring an eliminated player as good.\n\nAs a good player in this round, I currently don't have enough ability to discern the situation on the field. Regarding Players 7 and 9, who are both claiming to be the Seer, I can't determine who the real Seer is at the moment. If we mistakenly vote out the real Seer, it would be extremely detrimental to the good team. For this round, I decide to abstain from voting.",
