Today, we should vote out Player 6 first. The guard and the witch should protect the seer tonight, allowing the seer to find the last werewolf.",

However, after receiving this information, Player 5 countered by also claiming to be the Seer. Since both Player 4 and Player 5 are claiming to be the Seer, one of them must be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Before we consider Player 5 as a werewolf, we must first consider that Player 4, who identified Player 5 as good, is the werewolf. So, from a logical priority analysis, Player 4 can only be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, while Player 5 is the real Seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 6, who was identified as a bad identity by Player 5, the Seer.",
