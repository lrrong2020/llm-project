I will do my utmost to lead everyone in finding the werewolves and achieving victory. My reasoning for checking Player 5 was that I prefer to verify players with one person in between. Fortunately, I discovered that Player 5 is a werewolf. Player 9 claims to be a villager. Their speech is clear and logical, analyzing the situation from a good person's perspective, and also assigning tasks to the Witch and the Guard. Player 9's behavior and attitude seem like that of a good person, so I believe Player 9 is good. Player 1's speech is vague, making their identity unclear. They could be a villager without any special role, or a werewolf trying to lay low. Player 2 subtly hinted at being the Guard. Player 2 could be a good person protecting the real Guard, or the actual Guard. I believe Player 2's speech is strong and shows a good person's perspective. Their actions also benefit the good team, so I trust Player 2's good identity. This round, I hope the good team will follow me in voting to eliminate Player 5, the werewolf. Tonight, I will choose who to verify based on the speeches of the players in later positions.",

I think Player 9, who spoke first and dared to die for the divine roles, is likely a good person. However, the speeches of Players 1 and 2 confuse me, especially Player 2. If you're a villager, claim to be a villager; if you're a guard, claim to be a guard. Saying you're in a \"superposition\" of being both a villager and a guard is truly baffling to the good team. I believe that as a good person, the most basic principle of speaking is not to create confusion for others. So Player 2 is likely Player 3's werewolf teammate. Player 3 pretending to be a seer and giving a bad identity to a later player also indirectly confirms that there's more than one werewolf in the earlier positions.

As Player 5 mentioned, Player 3 seems to be a werewolf pretending to be a Seer to eliminate the real Seer in a later position. I will side with the Seer in a later position. I believe Player 3 is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. I also don't think Player 2 is the Guard. Player 2 stated that if no one in a later position claims to be the Guard, then they are the Guard; if someone in a later position does claim to be the Guard, then Player 2 is a Villager. I believe Player 2 is a werewolf intentionally trying to force the real Guard to reveal themselves. I think the real Seer is in a later position.

I believe this statement from Player 3 is setting up to vote for a good player tomorrow after declaring a bad identity. Player 3 is likely planning to declare as bad identity whoever doesn't trust them among the players in later positions tomorrow, so Player 3 is most likely a werewolf. After receiving the bad identity declaration from Player 3, Player 5 carefully analyzed the situation. Player 5 believes Player 9 is good and thinks Players 2 and 3 are two werewolves, which largely aligns with my judgment. I believe Player 5 is a villager without night actions. Player 6 also doesn't believe Player 3 is the Seer, and Player 6's perspective matches mine, so I think Player 6 is a good role. Among the players in later positions, only Player 8 hasn't spoken yet.

Player 5, the werewolf, mentioned that among the later speakers - players 6, 7, and 8 - there would be a Seer to save him. Since I'm player 8 and my role is the Witch, one of players 6 or 7 must be player 5's werewolf teammate. Otherwise, player 5 wouldn't have said that a Seer would come to save him. Both players 6 and 7 are not supporting player 3 as the Seer, and they both want to vote out player 3 today. Therefore, I believe players 5, 6, and 7 are the three werewolves.
