This kind of speech clearly shows they don't want the good people to identify who the real seer is. I don't know if either of them is the seer, but good people shouldn't pretend to be roles they're not. No. 5 and No. 7's claims of being checked as good identities are also mediocre, without any notable points. This round, I'm going to abstain from voting. I suggest No. 4 and No. 6 vote for each other. Good people should all abstain, and if the werewolves want to form a voting bloc, let them do it. This will expose the werewolf team, and then we can either poison or exile the exposed werewolves as needed.",

Yesterday, I sided with Player 4 because Player 6 spoke after Player 4 and seemed to mimic 4's speech pattern, both giving bad identities to players after them.

I poisoned Player 7 last night because I couldn't distinguish between Players 4 and 6 as the Seer. Since I couldn't tell, I decided to keep both on the field for another round of verification. Yesterday's voting results suggest that Players 2, 4, and 7 are one team, while Players 5 and 6 are another. Players 1 and 8 abstained, likely being good players unsure of the situation. Since Player 5 was voted out last round, I felt it necessary to poison Player 7 to maintain balance on the field. This round, I can't accept Player 2's claim to be the Guard and providing false protection information to deceive the good team. Therefore, Players 2, 4, and 7 might be the three werewolves.

As a player who has been in the dark throughout the game, I'm going to follow my great Witch, Player 3! I strongly agree with Player 3's point that Player 2 is deceiving the good team, because both the Werewolves and the Witch are well aware of the night kill information. The only ones kept in the dark are the good players who don't have night actions. So, Player 2's false guard report doesn't benefit the good team at all. Therefore, I don't believe Player 2 is the Guard, but since you're Player 6's good identity, I can only assume you're a good player who's trying to protect others! As for Player 6 mimicking Player 4's speech for two consecutive rounds, I'm speechless. If you, Player 6, are the Seer and playing like this, don't blame the good team for not being able to find you! This round, I can only follow the definitely good Player 3, the Witch, and side with Player 6. I've decided to vote for Player 4!",

I believe Player 2's vote for Player 5 in the previous round suggests the possibility that Player 2 might not be on the same team as Players 5 and 6. Moreover, given that the Witch has already sided with Player 6, if Player 6 were a werewolf, they could directly accuse Players 2 and 4 of being werewolves. Player 6 giving a good identity to Player 2, who is planning to side with Player 4, has no benefit if Player 6 is a werewolf. Therefore, Player 6's behavior doesn't align with that of a werewolf.
