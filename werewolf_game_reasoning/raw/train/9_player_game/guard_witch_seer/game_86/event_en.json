Why are you talking about public information? Moreover, couldn't it be that the Witch saw someone was killed and directly poisoned a player in the later position? You see Player 8 has now claimed to be the Witch? But you, Player 8, directly sided with Player 7 who is pretending to be a seer, I don't understand this move. I currently have reservations about your Witch identity, in my view, there's only a 50% chance you're the Witch, and the other 50% is that you're a werewolf.
