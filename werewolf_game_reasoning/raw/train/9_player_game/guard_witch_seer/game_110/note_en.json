I am a Werewolf.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be the Seer, reports Player 5 as bad identity, believes Player 9 is the real Guard, will check Player 7 tonight. Asks the Witch to consider poisoning Player 2 tonight, requests Player 9 to protect Player 3 at night, suggests the Witch save Player 9, and proposes to lynch Player 5 today.

Player 5 is my Werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 9 is the real Guard, thinks Player 3 is pretending to be a seer, Player 4 is Player 3's Werewolf partner, believes Player 5 is a Villager, will vote for Player 3. Player 7 is my Werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 9 is the real Guard, sides with Player 3, thinks Player 2 is a Werewolf, believes Player 1 is good. Arranges for the Witch to use the potion tonight, the Guard to protect the Seer, and votes for Player 5.
