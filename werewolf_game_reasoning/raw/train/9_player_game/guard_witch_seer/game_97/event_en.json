They could easily give it to the real Seer and be exposed. If we don't believe Player 8 is the Seer, we can only assume that both Player 8 and Player 9 are werewolves. Addressing Player 8, I find it questionable that you asked Player 9 to reveal their identity directly in your speech, and you didn't mention your probable verification target for tonight. These are my only minor doubts about Player 8. However, for now, I believe Player 8 is the real Seer and Player 9 is the real Guard. As Player 1, the Witch, I won't call for votes.

The credibility is indeed strong, but we can't rule out the possibility that a werewolf is taking a risk to gain this credibility! If a werewolf declares the real Seer as a good identity, the werewolf team would only lose one member, while the other two wolves can directly counter-attack. However, if they declare another innocent player as a good identity, they can gain the trust of the good team and greatly enhance their credibility as the Seer! Player 9 claimed to be the Guard. If no one in the later positions challenges this claim, I'm likely to believe Player 9's Guard identity. Since Players 5 and 6 both died last night, I think one of them might be the Witch who was killed and then used the poison on the other player. I'm skeptical about Player 1's Witch identity, but as a villager with no night actions, I can't immediately consider Player 1 as a werewolf. I can only say the probability of Player 1 being the Witch is about 50-50! Let's see if Player 4 in the last position will claim to be the Seer.

Since Number 8 also attacked Player 7 during their speech, I can assume that Player 7 is a good person, as a werewolf wouldn't likely attack their own teammate like that. I'm not sure about Number 9's identity as the Guard yet, because Numbers 5 and 6 both died on the first night, and one of them might have been a special role. So I reasonably suspect that Number 8 is giving a good identity to their fellow werewolf, trying to elevate Number 9's status. I'm also doubtful about Number 1's identity as the Witch, but since we have a bad identity card today - Number 8 - let's vote for Number 8 first. Tonight, I'll check Number 1's identity.",

To confuse the good players, I chose to pretend to be the witch.\n- However, after my speech, my werewolf teammate No.4 pretended to be the seer, gave a bad identity to the real seer No.8, and called for votes against No.8.\n- If I stick to my earlier support and vote for No.4, my werewolf teammate, the benefit would be too low, and it might result in No.4 being voted out, so I can't vote for my werewolf teammate No.4.\n- At the same time, I think No.4's speech as a fake seer was clear and logical, which might deceive good players who can't discern the situation clearly. There's a small chance it could successfully get No.8 voted out. So by not voting for No.4, I can also increase the possibility of the seer No.8 being eliminated.\n- I also can't rush to vote out No.8, because most good players currently believe No.8 is the seer. If I hastily vote for the real seer No.8, I'm very likely to be seen as an inconsistent werewolf by the good players, and No.8 might still not be eliminated. In tomorrow's speech phase, the good players would likely discover my werewolf identity, which would negatively impact the werewolf team's future situation.\n- If I abstain this round, I can better conceal my werewolf identity and dispel the good players' suspicions about my witch identity. Because if a werewolf pretends to be a special role, they would likely help the werewolves vote. So by pretending to be the witch and abstaining, which is counter-logical, I can enhance the credibility of my claimed identity.\nIn conclusion, I decide to abstain from voting this round.",

However, I believe it's unlikely that Player 9, as the guard, would foolishly self-guard last night. Therefore, Player 1 cannot be the witch and must be a werewolf. In the previous round, Players 3 and 4 voted for Player 8, indicating that Player 3 is a \"charging werewolf\". I believe the werewolves are Players 1, 3, and 4. At this point, Player 8, the seer, might be the only remaining special role. Although we're likely to lose, as a villager, I must do my best to vote out the werewolves. This round, I will vote along with Player 8, the seer.",

This was my thought process for verification. Player 2 praised my speech style yesterday as concise, logical, and conveying profound thoughts with simple words. Hearing this made me feel refreshed and comfortable, so I'm inclined to consider player 2 as a good civilian. Player 1 claimed to be the witch yesterday, saying they didn't save player 5 who was attacked, and instead poisoned player 6. Player 9 is my confirmed good identity and claimed to be the guard yesterday, being the only guard claim. In the situation where player 9 was attacked last night, it's impossible for player 1, if they were really the witch, not to save player 9. Also, player 9, knowing player 1 claimed to be the witch, wouldn't choose to guard themselves but would definitely guard player 1. If I'm wrong in my vote, it can only be because player 1's gameplay is problematic, and it's not my fault. In a normal game logic, player 1 can only be a werewolf pretending to be the witch.

I believe Number 9 would have definitely guarded Number 8 yesterday since he sided with him. So when I saw Number 9 was targeted, I saved him without hesitation. Let me explain why I abstained from voting yesterday. In my speech yesterday, I stated that I sided with Number 8. During the voting, I thought quickly and had two points of dissatisfaction with Number 8, which I mentioned in my speech yesterday. Also, Number 4 claimed to be the seer and said he would check Number 1 last night. Number 4 also accused Numbers 8 and 9 of being werewolves lynching their fellow werewolf, which aligns with my reasoning. Overall, Number 4's speech didn't clearly indicate to me that he was a werewolf, so I don't think Number 4 is necessarily a werewolf. The only point is that Number 4 happened to identify Number 8 as a bad identity. If Number 4 is the seer, then Number 8 is pretending to be a seer, and Number 7 would be Number 8's werewolf partner. If Number 8 is the seer, I think Number 7 could also be a reverse-hook werewolf. I, Number 1, am the witch. I think Number 8 might be a werewolf or the seer, considering he wasn't targeted last night. Number 9 is the guard, and Number 4 is either a werewolf or the seer. This round, I will most likely vote for Number 7 because Number 7 is in my werewolf pit.",

Given that I know I'm a good guy, if player 4 were the Seer, I don't think it's likely that I'd be the only good player siding with him. Therefore, I believe I made a mistake in my allegiance.\n\nBehavior analysis:\n- Player 8: Checked player 3 (me) as a good identity and called for votes against player 1. I think player 8's thought process in checking me is reasonable and meets my expectations for a Seer. Thus, I choose to switch sides and support player 8.\n- Player 1: Claimed to be the Witch and stated they saved player 9 last night. As the Guard, player 9 wouldn't be foolish enough to protect themselves knowing the Witch still had a potion, which would result in their elimination due to simultaneous protection and healing. Therefore, player 1's analysis of the night's information is illogical. I believe player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and the real Witch is either player 5 or 6, who were eliminated on the first day.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n- Vote for player 1: Since I'm siding with player 8 as the Seer, and player 8 is calling for votes against player 1, coupled with my belief that player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, I must ensure player 1 is eliminated.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 1.",

Player 9, who is my confirmed good identity, claimed to be the Guard yesterday. If player 1 were the real Witch, they would have almost certainly saved player 9 last night, knowing that 9 was the only Guard. Player 9, knowing that player 1 claimed to be the Witch, would most likely not have chosen to protect themselves but would have protected player 1 instead. Therefore, player 9's elimination reveals that player 1 is not the real Witch.\n- So, player 1 is most likely a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and the real Witch was either player 5 or 6 who were eliminated on the first day.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that player 1 is a werewolf.
