So, I decided to check player No. 5, and the result showed that No. 5 is a werewolf. No. 5 werewolf is pretending to be a villager this round. I'm addressing No. 2, No. 3, and No. 6 - if you are indeed villagers, then No. 5 has stolen your villager identity. No. 5 werewolf suggested that they might suspect either No. 4 or No. 9 to be the Seer, which is clearly an attempt to divert everyone's attention and make the good team mistakenly believe that the eliminated Seer is among No. 4 and No. 9. No. 6 followed No. 5's speech and agreed that either No. 4 or No. 9 might be the Seer, which makes me suspect that No. 6 might be a werewolf. Among the players in later positions, only No. 1 hasn't spoken yet, so I predict that No. 1 is likely to pretend to be the Seer. However, the speeches of No. 5 and No. 6 are also suggesting that No. 1 might not claim to be the Seer, indicating this might be a passive werewolf game.

Out of respect for the Seer, I followed Player 8's vote. However, since there was only one unchallenged Seer, and the first night wasn't peaceful, the identities of Players 4 and 9 were unknown, and I couldn't rule out the possibility that one of them might be the Seer. So, I had an extra consideration and didn't save Player 8. Now, if there were still two werewolves left, the wolf team wouldn't need to continue talking with the villagers and would have already stood up to fight. Therefore, I believe there's only one werewolf left, possibly Player 1. Player 1's speech was extremely brief, lacking a villager's perspective, and they haven't done anything to help the village. Today, I suggest the villagers follow my lead and vote to eliminate Player 1.",

Currently, if there were two werewolves present, they would have already formed a voting bloc, and werewolves wouldn't need to pretend anymore. Therefore, I deduce that only one werewolf remains. Since the Witch has a healing potion, we can't rule out the possibility of a werewolf killing their teammate to defraud the Witch's potion. Analyzing both sides of the logic: If Player 8 is the Seer, Player 5 is a werewolf, either Player 4 or 9 is a werewolf, and Player 2 is the Witch. If Player 1 were a werewolf, they would have likely pretended to be the Seer yesterday in the last speaking position, but they didn't. I believe Player 1 is probably good, which means Player 6 must be the last werewolf. If Player 8 is a werewolf, Player 5 is likely not a werewolf, as the werewolf team wouldn't pretend to be the Seer on the first day and vote for their own teammate. This means either Player 4 or 9 is still a werewolf, and Player 6 remains the last werewolf. In conclusion, I believe Player 6 is in my public werewolf slot, and yesterday Player 8 pointed out that Player 6's speech followed Player 5's, suggesting that Players 5 and 6 were both werewolves. I think Player 8 is likely the real Seer, and Player 6 is the last surviving werewolf. I will vote for Player 6.",

So if No. 8 is pretending to be a seer, No. 5 is likely not a werewolf. Since only one werewolf remains, one of the eliminated players (No. 4, 5, or 9) must have been a werewolf, which means either No. 1 or No. 6 is a werewolf.\n- If we assume No. 8 is the real seer, then No. 5 is the bad identity revealed by No. 8, and either No. 4 or No. 9 is a werewolf. No. 1, being the last to speak on the first day when only No. 8 had claimed to be the seer, would likely have also claimed to be the seer if they were a werewolf.
