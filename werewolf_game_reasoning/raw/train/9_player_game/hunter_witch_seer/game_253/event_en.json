Player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and tried to validate identities with their werewolf teammate, player 9. Unfortunately for them, player 9 foolishly gave a good identity to player 4, the real Seer, exposing their werewolf identities. This round, I will follow player 4's lead and vote to eliminate player 9, and I'll use my poison on player 7 tonight. Players 2, 3, and 8 have shown good perspectives in their speeches, as they all discussed the possibility of player 9 being a werewolf who killed one of their own to deceive us. This shows that players 2, 3, and 8 are thinking like good guys. Only player 1's identity remains unclear, and I suspect they are likely a werewolf. To be safe, I suggest that player 4, our Seer, should verify player 1's identity tonight. The werewolves will probably target me tonight, but player 4 should still have a chance to speak tomorrow.",

I didn't reveal myself on the first day because player 9 in the early position gave a good identity to a player in the later position. At that time, I believed we wouldn't eliminate a good player in the previous round, and I wasn't in a critical position, so I decided to verify one more night. Players 4 and 9 are two werewolves pretending to be Seers. Player 4 thinks that if player 5 were a werewolf, they wouldn't likely pressure player 6 to reveal their identity. Player 4 verified player 5 as good on the first day, and still believes 5 is unlikely to be a werewolf today, which is a mistake in their speech. As the real Seer, I know player 9 is also a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. Player 9 giving player 4 a good identity is likely a strategy discussed by the werewolf team at night. The werewolf in the early position pretends to be a Seer and gives a good identity to their werewolf teammate in the later position, who then turns against them to establish themselves as the Seer. On the first day, I verified player 2 as good, following the logic of checking players near me. On the second day, I verified player 8 as good. I chose to check player 8 because player 7 claimed to be the Witch, and player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer, so I checked player 8 between 7 and 9. Last night, two players died, which leads me to believe that among players 6 and 7, one is the Witch and one is a werewolf. Player 4 is likely the last remaining werewolf on the field. Today, I urge all good players to join me, the only true Seer, in voting to eliminate player 4.",
