No deaths.\n\nSpeeches and analysis:\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be the Seer, reports Player 2 as bad identity, calls for votes on Player 2. My analysis: Player 3 speaks first, giving Player 2 a bad identity is standard, seems like a Seer.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be a Villager, thinks Player 3's speech is normal, waiting to hear from later Seer claims.\n- **Player 5**: Doesn't claim a role, believes Player 4 is good, wants to hear Player 2's defense, might vote for Player 2. My analysis: Player 5 trusts Player 4, has a good perspective, possibly a Villager or Hunter.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be the Seer, reports Player 7 as good identity, believes Players 4 and 5 are likely good. My analysis: Player 6 is likely a Werewolf because Player 7 received Player 6's good identity but doesn't trust Player 6 as Seer. I believe Player 7 is the real Witch, making Player 6 a Werewolf.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be the Witch, reports saving Player 5. Believes Player 3 is the Seer and trusts them. My analysis: Player 7 is likely the real Witch because they received Player 6's supposed good identity but still trusts Player 3 as the Seer.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 7 is the Witch, wants to hear Player 2's speech. My analysis: Player 8 didn't give any workload to Players 3 and 6, so Player 3 is likely a Villager or Hunter.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be a Villager, trusts Player 6 as the Seer, believes Player 7 is the Witch. Wants to trust Player 6 and eliminate Player 3. My analysis: Player 9 is likely a Werewolf because Player 7 (Witch) is turning against Player 6, but Player 9 still supports Player 6 despite not being the Witch.\n- **Player 1**: Doesn't claim a role, wants to trust Player 6 as the Seer, believes Players 3 and 8 are Werewolves. My analysis: Player 1 is likely a good player who chose the wrong side. Player 2 accused Player 1 of being a Werewolf, even though Player 1 supported Player 6. Player 2 needed more Werewolf suspects and chose Player 1. Player 1 is probably a Villager.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a Villager, believes Player 1 is a Werewolf, wants to vote for Player 3. My analysis: Player 2 is likely a Werewolf because Player 1 trusts Player 6 as the Seer, but Player 2 (Player 3's bad identity) accused Player 1 (who trusts Player 6) of being a Werewolf. Player 2 made mistakes during the speech, revealing their Werewolf identity.\n\nIdentity judgments:\n**Player 1**: Villager\n**Player 2**: Werewolf\n**Player 3**: Seer\n**Player 4**: Villager\n**Player 5**: Villager or Hunter\n**Player 6**: Werewolf\n**Player 7**: Witch\n**Player 8**: Villager or Hunter\n**Player 9**: Werewolf\n\nMy vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 2.",
