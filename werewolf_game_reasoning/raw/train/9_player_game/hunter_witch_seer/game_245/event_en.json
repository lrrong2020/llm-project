If they turned out to be good, they could help me gather votes. If they were bad, we could directly vote them out. Last night was peaceful, thanks to the Witch using the healing potion to maintain village peace, though we can't rule out the possibility of werewolves killing one of their own to deceive us.\n\nI ask the Witch to pay attention to their saved player's speech. The Witch can choose to reveal themselves or not based on the situation. If they do, please indicate your potential poisoning target without conflicting with my next check. I advise the Hunter to stay hidden today, making it harder for werewolves to identify other villagers.\n\nNumber 3 is pretending to be the Seer and claims Number 2 has a bad identity. I'll carefully analyze Number 2's speech and voting pattern today to determine if they're good or a werewolf. Number 3's checking process seems fabricated based on the daytime speaking order. Normally, Number 3 would speak after Number 2, so they could simply analyze Number 2's speech. Why would they check a player whose speech they can hear?\n\nIf Number 2 fights back today and votes with me against Number 3, I'll consider them good. If Number 2 doesn't vote against Number 3 after being accused, I'll assume both are werewolves. In that case, I won't check Number 2 further but consider them a definite werewolf, and the Witch can poison them tonight! However, I think it's unlikely for werewolves to accuse their teammates. As long as Number 2's speech and voting align with mine, I won't suspect them of being a werewolf. For now, I consider Number 2 as potentially good.\n\nNumber 4 claims to be a villager but doesn't take sides. I think this shows good reasoning, not blindly choosing sides. If Number 4 votes with me against Number 3, they're likely good. Number 5 didn't reveal their identity but thinks Number 4 is good. As the real Seer, I need you good players to vote out the fake Seer with me. I won't blindly accuse any good players! If Number 5 votes with me against Number 3 today, I'll consider them good too.\n\nNo matter how eloquent werewolves are, their voting patterns don't lie. Unless they're playing as an extremely submissive werewolf, they'll vote either against me, the real Seer, or for their teammate's target. Werewolves aim to vote out good players together to gain an advantage.\n\nTonight, I'll check Number 9's identity. Today, I ask all good players to vote with me to eliminate Number 3.",

Secondly, if Player 3 were a werewolf, giving a bad identity to the last player wouldn't benefit the werewolf team's coordination. Player 6 said that Player 3 shouldn't have checked players whose speeches they could hear, which seems to assume Player 3 can verify identities, possibly a werewolf making mistakes during the speech. These are my conclusions based solely on the speeches of Players 3 and 6. However, I haven't heard Player 2's speech yet, so I'll make my final decision on whether to side with Player 3 after listening to Player 2.

Even before hearing No. 6's speech, I thought that No. 5, who spoke earlier, protected No. 4, which means No. 5's identity must be lower than No. 4's. No. 6 also mentioned this point in their speech, which aligns with my observation. So, No. 6 didn't randomly accuse good people of being werewolves, as only werewolves would label good players with poor speeches as werewolves.\n\nNo. 7 claimed to be the Witch and said they would likely side with No. 3, reasoning that No. 3 isn't afraid to declare a bad identity for a god role, so No. 7 finds No. 3 highly credible. I think if No. 3 were a werewolf, even if they declared a bad identity for a god role, No. 3's werewolf teammates could still identify two god roles, which would be beneficial for the werewolf team. I don't think it's good for No. 7 to side with No. 3 based on this point.\n\nHowever, currently, only No. 7 has claimed to be the Witch, and No. 7 is a good identity according to No. 6, whom I believe to be the Seer. Moreover, No. 7 changed their mind and didn't side with No. 6, so I believe No. 7 is the real Witch. I will side with No. 6 and vote to eliminate No. 3.",

Player 6's thought process was clear and logical, analyzing the situation from a good person's perspective, commenting on the speeches of players in earlier positions, and arranging tasks for the special roles, even considering unknown possibilities. After hearing Player 6's speech, I can fully believe that Player 6 is the Seer. I hope Player 7, the Witch, can reconsider and not take the wrong side, but trust that Player 6 is the Seer. Player 8 thinks Player 6 seems like the Seer, but because Player 7 turned against Player 6's good identity, Player 8 couldn't clearly state their stance. I believe Player 8 completely lacks the thought process of a good person; their speech is very much like a werewolf's, hesitant and evasive. So I think Player 8 is most likely a werewolf. Currently, in my mind, the werewolf suspects are Players 3 and 8. As for the last werewolf, I haven't found them yet.

I believe No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 are the three werewolf cards. No. 1 was the first to speak, analyzing the voting pattern and considering No. 9 as a werewolf, finally saying they would vote according to No. 3's verification.
