My thought process for checking player 5 was to verify someone nearby. Usually, I check players in positions after mine, but this time I had a sudden idea to check player 5 who was before me, and it proved to be fruitful, catching a big bad wolf! Player 5, who is a werewolf, claimed to have checked player 7 as a good identity and could \"lock\" player 6's identity. I don't know where this absurd theory comes from. As we all know, player identities are completely randomly assigned, so how can one \"lock\" an identity? In other words, if you, player 5, want to \"lock\" my identity, I'll oblige. I'm giving you my identity - I am the Seer, and player 5, who is pretending to be the Seer, should prepare to be voted out!\n\nI thought I would speak first, which would have made my accusation against player 5 much stronger. Unexpectedly, player 5 gained the advantage of speaking order and deliberately used reverse logic to sway opinions by claiming player 7, who is already out, as a good identity. Player 5's strategy of pretending to be the Seer is to make the good players think, \"Wow, player 5 claimed an eliminated player as good, which has no benefit for werewolves, so player 5 must be the Seer.\" I hope the good players present can discern right from wrong and not be fooled by player 5's petty tricks!\n\nPlayer 7, the Hunter, took player 1 with them. I can't determine player 1's identity and can only hope that player 1 is a werewolf who was taken out. I believe the Witch is likely still in the game. If player 1 was unfortunately the Witch taken out by the Hunter, we've already lost! The Witch should definitely not reveal themselves today to avoid being killed by werewolves at night and unable to use the healing potion.\n\nPlayer 4, who spoke first, gave an ambiguous speech, and I can't define their identity. Tonight, I will check the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on the speeches and voting patterns. I urge all good players to join me in voting out player 5, who is pretending to be the Seer.",

No.4's speech was brief and vague, but as the first speaker, we can be more tolerant. As a villager, if I were in the first position, I would probably give a similar speech due to lack of information, so I believe No.4 is a good guy. I think No.6 claims to be the Seer, and their speech aligns with the Seer's perspective, with clear logic and a complete thought process, so I tentatively believe No.6 is the real Seer. No.5 claims to be the Seer and declares No.7 as a good identity, but seems very surprised that their good identity is the Hunter.

I have both potions, so the werewolf team can only use their kill to test if I'm the real Witch.

I think No. 5 is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer, trying to deceive the good team with this \"dragon-locking\" nonsense. So let me ask No. 5: just because you claim to have verified No. 7 as a good identity, does that necessarily prove whether No. 6 is a werewolf or a good person? If that's how a Seer determines identities, then I'm sorry, but your speech fails to gain the trust of the good team. We need a Seer who can clearly guide us, not a \"charlatan.\"\n\nNo. 1 was eliminated by No. 7's Hunter shot, so their identity is unknown. Surely the Witch wasn't killed off? Up until my last speech, only No. 9 has claimed to be the Witch, but hasn't reported using the potion yet, which makes me suspect that No. 1 might have been the Witch. The fact that No. 2 can believe No. 5 is the Seer makes me suspect that No. 2 is No. 5's werewolf teammate. Currently, I suspect No. 2 and No. 5 as werewolves.\n\nToday, I will follow No. 6, who I believe is the Seer, and vote for No. 5 to be eliminated as a werewolf. If the Witch is still in the game, please make sure to use your potion tonight. On behalf of the good team, I sincerely thank you.",
