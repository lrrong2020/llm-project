First, only the Werewolves and the Witch know who the saved player is. The Witch revealing the saved player's position would help the good team analyze the logic better. Whether the good team can identify the saved player should be left for everyone to discuss together, rather than hiding this crucial information. Moreover, 6 suggested that the Witch should observe the saved player's speech before deciding to reveal herself or not. How can 6 be sure that the Witch will speak after the saved player? What if the Witch speaks before the saved player? How can the Witch judge the saved player's identity then? Should the Witch reveal herself or not? This is a logical flaw.\n\nSecondly, after being identified as a Werewolf, 7 chose to claim the Witch role and reported that 5 was the saved player. I don't think 7 is a Werewolf. If 7 were a Werewolf pretending to be the Witch, they would likely expose another fellow Werewolf. Given that we know the Witch has no more antidote after the peaceful first night, it might be a safer strategy for Werewolves to stay hidden and try to eliminate the Seer. Therefore, I believe 7 is likely the real Witch, and 6 is suspicious of being a Werewolf.\n\nThis round, I will probably side with the Seer in the later speaking positions and vote to eliminate player 6.",

No. 6 claimed to be a seer and accused No. 7 of being a werewolf, while No. 7 claimed to be the witch. I'm not sure if No. 6 and No. 7 are werewolves trying to frame each other, but No. 6 is definitely not the real seer - I am. No. 6 must be pretending to be a seer. No. 8 claimed to be the hunter and their analysis shows good-person thinking, so I believe No. 8 is the real hunter. No. 9 claimed to be a villager and chose to side with the later-speaking seer when only No. 6, the fake seer, had spoken earlier. I'm not sure if No. 9 could be a werewolf, siding with the real seer in the later position after seeing their werewolf teammate No. 6 accuse No. 7, who might be the witch. Therefore, I'll check No. 9 tonight. If No. 7 is the witch, No. 6 is a werewolf, and No. 9 is a role that can be checked, and with No. 3's werewolf teammate No. 6 already exposed, I only need to find one more werewolf in the outer positions. No. 1 joked about being the hunter but then said they were just a villager. I think No. 1's relaxed speech suggests they're likely good, but I disagree with their view that No. 6 and No. 7 are probably not working together. If No. 6 and No. 7 are both werewolves, No. 6 could still communicate with the witch, encouraging them to reveal themselves to make it easier for werewolves to kill the witch at night. In summary, No. 3 and No. 6 are two werewolves. As for No. 7's identity, I just need to see if they vote with me. Even if No. 7 is No. 6's werewolf teammate trying to frame me, the real seer No. 2, I'll still protect you until the final round. No. 4 and No. 5 haven't spoken yet, so for now I'll check No. 9's identity tonight. If No. 4 or No. 5 cast an unusual vote or clearly side with No. 6, the fake seer, I might check one of them instead of No. 9 tonight. I'm No. 2, the only real seer in the game, calling for votes against No. 3, the werewolf I identified. If the witch trusts me, they can use their poison on No. 6 tonight.",

I ask you, No. 2, is this what a Seer should be thinking about? Whether they're werewolves lynching each other is irrelevant to you because today, you, No. 2, should be voting for me, No. 3. Therefore, No. 2 is a werewolf who made mistakes during their speech. I believe No. 1 is a good player because they falsely claimed to be the Hunter and then retracted it; a werewolf wouldn't risk such behavior.

From 6's perspective as a Seer, 7 should be a werewolf, so there's no need to engage in dialogue with 7 and waste valuable time. As a villager with no night actions, I feel that 6's speech resembles a werewolf nervously pretending to be the Seer and trying to target the later speakers, fearing they might accuse a powerful god role. But we think 6 was so unlucky that they actually accused the Witch of being a werewolf. I trust that 8 is the Hunter because there's no benefit for werewolves to claim the Hunter role at this stage. 3's speech is even more ridiculous, trying to \"order\" Hunter 8 to change their mind? If you were the Witch, shouldn't you use sincere words and passionate speech to move the good team? So I believe 3's speech fails to gain the trust of the good team, lacking even basic \"politeness\". Currently, the werewolf suspects are 3 and 6. I side with 2 and vote to eliminate player 3.",

Player 3 pretending to be the witch as a werewolf is quite ridiculous, giving a good identity to a hunter who spoke earlier. Isn't this clearly a werewolf trying to force the hunter to side with the werewolf team? You saw that the hunter's speech was going to strongly vote for your werewolf teammate, so you chose to pretend to be the witch and forcefully give the hunter a good identity, wanting the hunter to side with you werewolves? I think hunter 8 has a keen eye, able to accurately find the werewolf pretending to be the seer, and strongly calling for a vote on player 6. The werewolves, seeing this speech, felt they had no chance and forcefully tried to pull the hunter to their side. I'm sorry to disappoint the werewolf team, but I believe player 2 is the real seer, players 3 and 6 are both werewolves, and everyone is targeting player 6 as a werewolf. I don't believe the entire group could side with the wrong player! Today, as the last to speak, I will lead all the good people to vote for the werewolf. Good people, listen to my vote call.

Moreover, I believe No.7's early claim to be the Witch carries significant weight, so No.3's later claim to be the Witch suggests they might be rushing to support No.6 as a fellow werewolf. No.3 is highly likely to be a werewolf.\n- **Player No.7**: No.7 claimed to be the Witch early on after being declared as bad. This doesn't align with werewolf interests because the first night was peaceful. If No.7 were a werewolf, they could have simply pretended to be the Seer. Even if voted out, the werewolves could eliminate the real Seer at night, allowing the remaining two werewolves to better conceal their identities. This would be highly beneficial for the werewolves. Instead, pretending to be the Witch as No.7 did risks being exposed by the good team and guarantees that the real Witch can poison a werewolf. This strategy has low benefits. Therefore, No.7 is likely the real Witch.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe No.3 is highly likely to be a werewolf, so voting for No.3 this round is the better choice.",

Their verification process seems reasonable, their speech is comprehensive, they analyze the situation from a good player's perspective, demonstrating a Seer's viewpoint. They believe players 1 and 9 are good, which aligns with my perspective, so I trust player 2 is the Seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 2 is the true Seer.\n# Probability ranking of werewolves:\n- 3, 6 > 2, 7\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 3.",

If Number 7 were the real witch and was identified as a bad identity by Number 6, who would be a werewolf in this case, she wouldn't have hesitated to poison Number 6. Number 7's behavior doesn't make any sense. Today, I'm voting to eliminate Number 7, to honor the memory of Number 3, the witch. Although the good side is already at a disadvantage, we shouldn't give up our last glimmer of hope.",

Player 2 stated that regardless of how Player 7 speaks, they believe Player 7 is the real witch. This is clearly impossible for Player 7 to be the real witch today, so Player 2 and Player 7 are likely werewolves on the same team.\n\n- **Player 6**: This round, they gave Player 5 a good identity, and in the previous round, they gave Player 7 a bad identity. If Player 7 were the real witch, they wouldn't have hesitated to use their poison on Player 6 after being identified as a bad identity. Therefore, Player 7's behavior is unjustifiable, so Player 7 can only be a werewolf, which means Player 6 is the true seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 6 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for Player 7.",
