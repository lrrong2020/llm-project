With Player 2 claiming witch and saving Player 1, I believe Player 8 must be a werewolf pretending to be the witch after receiving bad identity.\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf identity\n\n**Player 9**:\n- Player 9 claims to be a villager. Believes Player 6 is the hunter, will vote for Player 7 if no one else claims witch, otherwise will analyze further.\n- I think this is a perspective of a non-special role, possibly a villager card.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager identity\n\n**Player 1**:\n- Player 1 claims to be the seer, gave bad identity to Player 9, believes Players 7 and 9 are werewolves, tentatively thinks Player 5 is good, will check Player 2 tonight, suggests exiling Player 9 and asks the witch to poison Player 7.\n- I don't think Player 1 seems like the seer, Player 9's speech sounds like a good identity, and Player 1's accusation of players who have already spoken lacks conviction. Player 1 seems more like a werewolf pretending to be the seer to protect Player 8 who received bad identity from the real seer.\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf identity\n\n**Player 2**:\n- Player 2 claims to be the witch. Saved Player 1, believes Player 7 is the seer, suggests exiling Player 1 and poisoning Player 8 tonight.\n- I believe Player 2 is the real witch. Player 8's earlier claim as witch after receiving bad identity wasn't convincing. Also, if Player 2 were a werewolf claiming to be the witch, they would risk being poisoned at night, which has no benefit.\nSubjective identity judgment: Witch identity\n\n**Player 3**:\n- Player 3 claims to be a villager, believes Player 1 is the seer, doesn't trust Player 2 as the witch. Wants to vote for Player 1.\n- Player 3 thinks Player 1's argument is stronger than Player 7's. I find Player 3's reason for attacking Player 7 unconvincing, so I think Player 3 is likely a werewolf.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager or lower identity\n\n**Player 4**:\n- Player 4 claims to be a villager. Believes Player 6 is the hunter, hasn't clearly taken sides, thinks one more werewolf will be found among Players 3, 5, and 9.\n- Player 4 is analyzing the situation with a good person's perspective, but I think Player 4's last position speech is a bit evasive, possibly a werewolf.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager or lower identity",
