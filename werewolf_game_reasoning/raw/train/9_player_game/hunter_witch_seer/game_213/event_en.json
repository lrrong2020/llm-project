My thought process for verifying Number 6 was to check the identity of a player in a later position. If they turned out to be good, they could help me gather votes; if bad, I could directly vote them out. First, I think Number 7's speech is overly affected. Number 7 expresses deep resentment towards the Witch for not saving someone at night but instead poisoning someone, leading to Number 5 Hunter's elimination. This is an irresponsible approach. I believe villagers shouldn't accuse the Witch so harshly and unreasonably, as it was just a misjudgment. I suspect Number 7 might be a werewolf pretending to gain the trust of good players through reverse logic. Number 9, who is pretending to be a seer, gives a good identity to Number 7, who is suspected to be a werewolf. This actually makes me doubt Number 7's identity even more. I think Number 9 is giving a good identity to their fellow werewolf. Number 7 and Number 9 are likely a pair of werewolves! Number 9 suggests voting out Number 8 this round. Have you overlooked the player in a later position who is also claiming to be a Seer? Number 9's perspective has a serious flaw, completely lacking the viewpoint a good player should have! Number 9 is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer against me. Today, I, Number 4 Seer, call for votes against Number 9, the fake Seer!",

No. 9 is also pretending to be a Seer against me, claiming No. 7 as a good identity in the early speaking order.\n\nAnalysis of the possibility that No. 9 and No. 4 are good players trying to protect the real Seer:\n\n- Player No. 9: Spoke early, claiming No. 7 as a good identity.\n- Player No. 4: Spoke last, claiming me (No. 9) as a good identity.\n- Analyzing the credibility, No. 9 has a higher possibility of protecting the Seer than No. 4.\n- Reverse logic: If No. 4 is a good player, given that No. 9 claimed to be the Seer early on, No. 6 who spoke last could potentially be the real Seer. In this case, if No. 4 is a good player claiming No. 6 as a good identity, and if No. 6 turns out to be the real Seer, No. 4 would likely ruin their own game and get voted out.\n- Furthermore, even if No. 4 is a villager trying to protect the Seer, they shouldn't claim the last speaker as a good identity. They should claim an early speaker or an eliminated player as a good identity to minimize risk.\n- Therefore, the possibility of No. 4 being a werewolf pretending to be the Seer is much higher than No. 9.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n\n- Vote for Player No. 4: I am the Seer, and I verified that No. 7 has a good identity. No. 4 and No. 9 are both pretending to be the Seer against me. I believe No. 9 is pretending to be the Seer to protect the real Seer, while No. 4 is pretending to be the Seer and claiming No. 6 (me) as a good identity, which means No. 4 must be a werewolf. As the Seer, my responsibility is to use my verification ability to identify the werewolves and lead the good players to lynch them. Therefore, I will vote for No. 4, who is pretending to be the Seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player No. 4.",
