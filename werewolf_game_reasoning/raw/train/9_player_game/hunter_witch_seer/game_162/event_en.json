Last night, I checked the player next to me, number 6, and found them to be a bad identity! It seems that number 3 was the Hunter who was killed and used their gun to take out player 2. I just hope that number 2 wasn't the Witch, otherwise the werewolves have already won! Number 4, who is pretending to be a Seer, claimed number 9 as a good identity. As the second speaker, I can't gather much information, so I tentatively plan to check number 9 tonight, though I might change my target based on the speeches and voting patterns. Number 4 is clearly taking a risky approach, trying to convince us of the validity of their check. Number 4's werewolf teammate will surely stand up and charge forward, saying something like, \"Number 4's ability to identify a good identity in a later position carries a lot of weight, so I support number 4!\" I hope the good guys can find me. With me, the old Seer, leading the team, we should unanimously vote out number 6, the bad identity, today. If the Witch is still alive, they should act according to the situation tonight.",

However, Player 6 suggests that Player 4 could be either a werewolf or a Seer, and that Player 5 doesn't seem like a Seer. Therefore, I deduce that Player 5 is Player 6's werewolf teammate, intentionally using a speech that makes mistakes to confuse the good players' perception, encouraging them to side with Player 5 and increase the credibility of Player 5 giving Player 6 a bad identity. Player 7 claims to be the Witch and threatens Player 9, forbidding them from siding with Player 4, the real Seer. I believe Player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, forcefully supporting their werewolf teammate Player 5, and by voting for their werewolf teammate Player 6, they're trying to strengthen Player 5's identity as a werewolf pretending to be a Seer. In conclusion, I think Player 3 is the confirmed Hunter, Player 6 is Player 5's werewolf teammate, and Players 5 and 6 are using the tactic of a werewolf giving a bad identity to another werewolf to confuse the good players' perspective. Player 7 is also a werewolf teammate of Players 5 and 6, while Player 8 is the real Witch. Addressing Player 7, I bet you don't have the poison, and I will continue to support Player 4. I will vote for Player 6.",

If No. 6 were a good person, after receiving a bad identity check from No. 5 yesterday, they should have firmly supported Seer No. 4. However, No. 6 only stated that they think No. 4 could be either a werewolf or a seer. No. 6 believes that regardless of whether No. 4 is a werewolf or not, the good identity No. 4 gave to No. 9 must be genuine. No. 6 thinks No. 5's speech doesn't sound like a seer, but rather like a werewolf. No. 6 wants to support No. 4. There are several flaws in No. 6's logic: firstly, they still consider the possibility of No. 4 being a werewolf; secondly, they blindly believe No. 9 is good. As a good person receiving a bad identity check from No. 5, No. 6 should see No. 5 as definitely a werewolf and No. 4 as definitely the seer. This is enough to prove that No. 6 is undoubtedly a werewolf. I can't distinguish between No. 7 and No. 8's speeches, but one of them is a werewolf and the other is the witch. You two can sort it out at night. Today, I'm voting to eliminate No. 6.",

I believe that the witch should be like No. 7 - upright, outspoken, and using their sharp mind to analyze the werewolf positions. This is how we can help the good team choose the right side! No. 8's speech was so brief, how could they possibly handle the witch role? It's utterly ridiculous and laughable! No. 4 is pretending to be the seer, No. 6 is the bad identity I found, and No. 8 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch. We've identified all three werewolves. No. 1 and No. 9 in the outer positions, you two are definitely good! Addressing No. 9, I hope you won't easily believe the good identity given to you by the werewolf No. 4. The good identity I'm giving you truly represents the light of justice shining upon the earth! Today, I, the old seer, vote for No. 4, the fake seer. Victory is ours!",

No. 7 stated yesterday that if No. 9 strongly supported No. 4, they would poison No. 9; otherwise, they would poison No. 4. If No. 7 were the Witch, they would have certainly poisoned either No. 4 or No. 9 to prove their identity, rather than inconsistently poisoning No. 8. Therefore, No. 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, while No. 8 was the real Witch. This round, I still choose to support No. 4. No. 4 has identified No. 1 as a bad identity this round, and I also believe No. 1 is a werewolf. Yesterday, No. 1 said that No. 6's blind judgment of No. 9 as a good person seemed like the perspective of a werewolf with open eyes. Today, No. 1 advised me, No. 9, to \"return to the good side,\" which means No. 1, like No. 6, is also blindly judging No. 9 as a good person, even though I, No. 9, have been consistently supporting No. 4, whom No. 1 considers to be a fake Seer. In conclusion, I judge No. 1, No. 5, and No. 7 to be the three werewolves, and yesterday No. 1, No. 5, and No. 7 all voted for No. 6. So, No. 6 should be a villager with flaws in their speech, No. 4 is the Seer, No. 9 is a villager, No. 3 is the Hunter, No. 2 is the eliminated villager, and No. 8 was the Witch. I vote for No. 1.",
