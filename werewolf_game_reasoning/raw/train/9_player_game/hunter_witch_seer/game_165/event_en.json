Last night was peaceful, which means the Witch has already used her healing potion. I have a feeling that the werewolves will try to kill me tonight. Since there's no Guard, I will probably be eliminated tomorrow! As the first speaker, I can't analyze much more information. I hope the werewolves in later positions will bravely pretend to be the Seer, so that we good people can work together to exile a werewolf on the first day! This round, let's listen to Number 6's speech. I believe that Number 6, as a confirmed good person, will lead everyone. I'm entrusting my wish of exiling a werewolf to Number 6!",

Let me summarize Player 2's speech: \"I'm a werewolf, I declare Player 6 as good, I'll be killed by werewolves tonight, Player 6 should lead the vote!\" I am your true Seer, don't be fooled by the werewolves' sweet talk. Let me analyze: Player 2 claimed to be the Seer in the first speech, which means there might be werewolves in the middle and later positions. He chose to declare Player 6 as good, so I'll temporarily consider Player 6 as a good role. Player 5 is the good person I verified, Player 3 claimed to be the Witch this round and reported Player 8 as saved. I'll consider Player 8 as a good role for now. I believe the remaining two werewolves can only be among Players 7, 9, and 1. Tonight, I only need to verify the one good person among these three players!

Player 8's speech can be summed up in four words: \"giving up resistance\". If you were a villager and were given a bad identity by a werewolf, shouldn't you be furious and angrily strike back at player 7? But you, player 8, are actually asking everyone to vote for you.

I believe a Seer should define other players' identities through verification, not make arbitrary judgments like player 4, so I think player 4 is a werewolf.\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 8 as a bad identity. Player 8's speech suggests that all players should vote them out, which is tantamount to admitting being a werewolf. I believe good players should speak positively, not give up like player 8, so player 8 must be a werewolf.

I initially thought Player 9 was a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, but today it seems Player 9 was a villager who claimed to be the Hunter to protect me. To Player 9, let's vote for Player 7 today. I'll follow through on what I said yesterday and call for votes on Player 7!\n\nLooking at last round's voting results, Player 2 was eliminated with the most votes. Player 7 gave Player 8 a bad identity check yesterday but didn't vote for Player 8, instead voting for Player 2. This shows that Players 2 and 7 are not on the same team. Player 2 voted alone for Player 4 yesterday, indicating that Players 2 and 4 are also not on the same team. Both Players 4 and 7 coincidentally voted for Player 2, leading me to conclude that Player 2 was likely the real Seer, while Players 4 and 7 are werewolves.\n\nI'm the Hunter. Player 3, the Witch, was killed and then poisoned Player 4, confirming Player 3's identity as the Witch. Player 1, the Hunter, is calling for votes on Player 7 today. Please trust me, good people.
