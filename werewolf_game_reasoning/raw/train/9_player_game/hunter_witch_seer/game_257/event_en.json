Currently, only Number 2 has claimed to be the Seer, and no one has challenged their claim. I suspect Number 1 is likely to pretend to be the Seer as well. If Number 5 were a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, they would put themselves in a position to be voted out and sacrifice another werewolf, which offers no benefit to the werewolf team, so I believe 5 is the real Hunter.
