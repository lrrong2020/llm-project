I am a villager.\n- **Player 6**: Claims seer, gives bad identity to 7, thinks 5 is good, wants to vote out 7. I analyze that Player 6's speech has a seer's perspective, and 6 thinks I'm good, which matches my actual identity. Also, 7 immediately claimed seer, if 6 were a werewolf, I don't believe a werewolf speaking this early could successfully challenge the real seer. I think 6 is the real seer.\n- **Player 7**: Claims seer, gives good identity to 8, thinks 5 is good, wants to vote out 6. I analyze that 7 immediately claimed seer, but in terms of credibility and speech quality, 6 is superior to 7. I think 7 is a werewolf.\n- **Player 8**: Claims hunter, believes 6 is the seer, thinks 7 is a werewolf, wants to vote out 7. I analyze that 8 claims hunter and sides with 6, I think 7 and 8 are likely not on the same team. I believe 8 is the real hunter.\n- **Player 9**: Claims witch, gives silver water to 7, believes 7 is the seer, thinks 8 is the hunter, wants to vote out 6.

I analyze that Player 1 has no special perspective, likely a villager.\n- **Player 2**: Claims hunter, believes 7 is the seer, thinks 6 and 8 are werewolves, wants to vote out 8. I analyze that objectively 7 claimed seer and gave good identity to 8, yet 2 says they trust 7 as seer but want to vote out 8. I think 2 is a werewolf who made mistakes during their speech.\n- **Player 3**: Claims witch, gives silver water to 9, thinks 7 and 9 are werewolves, believes 6 is the seer, thinks 2 is a werewolf, wants to vote out 7. I analyze that Player 3's werewolf suspicions align with mine (Player 5), I think 3 is the real witch.\n- **Player 4**: Claims villager, believes 6 is the seer, thinks 7 and 9 are werewolves, believes 3 is the witch, wants to vote out 7.
