I understand that in this situation, you may have doubts about my identity, but please trust my upcoming speech and judgments.

Therefore, I side with No. 6, and today I will vote for No. 7. I suspect No. 2 is the third werewolf. No. 2 claims to be the hunter and sides with No. 7, yet wants to vote for No. 8, claiming that No. 8 is a werewolf pretending to be a hunter against him. However, No. 8 is No. 7's good identity, and No. 7 and No. 8 are on the same side. How can you, No. 2, side with No. 7 but vote for No. 7's good identity, No. 8? No. 2's speech has logical errors, so I can only conclude that No. 2 is a werewolf, while No. 8 is the real hunter.
