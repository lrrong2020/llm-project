I've listened to all players' speeches and analyzed the situation, which I'll share with the good team. First, No.7 claimed to be the Seer and gave No.8 a good identity. No.8 immediately sided with No.7, so I believe No.8 is a simple-minded villager. No.8 lacks critical thinking, but has a good person's perspective as they analyzed the situation. Second, No.9 stated that because No.8 directly sided with No.7, they think No.7 and No.8 are not on the same team. I don't understand No.9's reasoning; from their perspective, shouldn't No.7 and No.8 potentially be two werewolves covering for each other? However, since there are currently three werewolves and three divine roles in conflict, No.9 can only be a good person with flawed logic. No.1 and No.4 both claim to be the Witch. No.1's speech is incredibly foolish - just because No.5 is their saved player, they would immediately side with No.5 if they claimed to be the Seer? In contrast, No.4's speech was excellent, with clear logical thinking and precise wording, while analyzing the situation from a good person's perspective. So, I believe No.4 is the Witch. No.3 dares to claim to be the Hunter; I can only say to this werewolf No.3: You're asking for death! Since you've stepped up to die, don't blame my bullet for causing you pain! As No.1 claimed to be the Witch and saved No.5, saying they would side with No.5 if they claimed to be the Seer, I strongly suspect No.1 and No.5 are two werewolves covering for each other. I analyze that the werewolf positions are No.1, No.3, and No.5. I believe No.7 is the Seer. This round, I, the Hunter, vote for No.3. No.4, the Witch, should poison No.1 tonight, and tomorrow we'll vote out No.5.",

The reason is that player 3 thinks player 8 is a good person who seriously analyzes the situation, so player 3 believes player 7's verification is convincing. I think player 3's speech doesn't have major issues, but there's also no strong evidence to prove that player 3 is the Hunter. Therefore, I can't clearly determine whether player 3 is the real Hunter, and we need to consider player 6's speech as well.\n- **Player 6**: The last player to speak, claiming to be the Hunter and supporting player 4. The speech is highly provocative, analyzes a lot of logic, comments on the identities of the players who spoke before, and includes a large section about their mentality. I think player 6's logic and mentality are more like a real Hunter, and player 6's mentality doesn't seem like that of a werewolf.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe player 6 is most likely the Hunter, and I will vote for player 3 in this round.",

So No. 5, who claimed No. 6 had a good identity, must be a werewolf. I didn't need to check No. 5 last night; No. 5 is definitely a werewolf in my view. Yesterday, No. 1 and No. 4 both claimed to be the Witch, so one of them must be the real Witch and the other a werewolf. I believe they would resolve their dispute during the night, so there was no need to verify either of their identities, which would waste a verification opportunity. No. 8 was my good identity from yesterday, and No. 9 is my good identity for today. I hope the good people will follow me, the real Seer, and everyone vote for No. 5, the werewolf pretending to be a Seer.",
