Otherwise, how could Player 3 secretly peek through the door crack when I was verifying Player 6 last night? Regardless, I'm quite satisfied with this speaking order. At least, whether Player 6 decides to immediately pretend to be the Seer or resign to claiming villager, my bad identity reveal has put invisible pressure on them. I believe under such pressure, their speech will inevitably have flaws, allowing the good players to confirm their werewolf identity through their speech. Player 4's speech was standard, so I tentatively define Player 4 as a good identity. Otherwise, they should have done something harmful in this golden position to pretend to be the Seer. Now, let's invite the little werewolf Player 6 to give their final words~",

I believe there's no need for werewolves to pretend to be the Witch and ask for poison in the first position before the real and fake Seers have claimed their roles. This behavior has no benefit for the werewolf team. No. 4 in the early position didn't follow suit and immediately confirm that I, No. 7, am good. Instead, they maintained a cautious consideration of the situation. I think No. 4 has a higher probability of being a good person. I believe No. 3 and No. 6 must be on opposite sides. If they were werewolf teammates, why would they operate like this? If No. 3 were a werewolf, they would surely be poisoned by the real Witch. Moreover, why would No. 3 deliberately put pressure on their werewolf teammate No. 6 to lower No. 6's credibility as a Seer? I think No. 3 and No. 6 are definitely not on the same side! Regarding the speeches of No. 5 and No. 6, the two claiming to be Seers, I'm more inclined to believe No. 5 is the real Seer, because if No. 5 were a werewolf, the probability of accurately identifying the Seer would be quite low. Furthermore, No. 6 didn't mention or comment on player No. 4 at all, so I think No. 6's perspective is limited, unlike a normal good person's view. I believe No. 3 is the Witch, I temporarily consider No. 4 as a good person, No. 5 is the Seer, and No. 6 is a werewolf who pretended to be the Seer immediately after being identified as a bad identity. Finally, I'll listen to No. 2's speech. This round, I will most likely vote directly for No. 6!",

I think player 2 might be a good identity that was falsely identified as bad by player 6, the werewolf. In short, from your perspective as player 6, all werewolves have been identified, but you didn't mention anything about \"finding all three werewolves\" in your speech.

Since no one has claimed to be the Witch against Number 3 today, Number 3 must be the real Witch. Number 1's speech directly accused Number 9 of being a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, so Number 1 can only be one of two identities: either the real Hunter or a werewolf with information. If Number 1 is the Hunter, then there must be another werewolf among the players claiming to be villagers. Number 3, the Witch, threw a water bomb at Number 6, yet Number 6 immediately assumed Number 3 was a werewolf. I believe Number 6's speech doesn't align with the Seer's perspective. Your speech is simply illogical, with a distorted viewpoint, not meeting the expectations of what a good person would expect from a Seer.

I can only vote against Seer No. 5 and vote for my werewolf teammate No. 6 to be eliminated. This way, I can avoid exposing my werewolf identity too early, wait for an opportunity to kill Seer No. 5 during the night, disguise myself as a good player, confuse the good players through my speech, and mislead their perspective to vote against the remaining good players.\nConsidering all of this, I decide to vote for Player No. 6.",

To the witch, I don't know why you didn't use your poison on 9 last night. Were you afraid they might be the real hunter, so you didn't dare to use the poison? To the good players in the later positions, I strongly call for votes against player 9. However, I haven't found the third werewolf yet. Player 7's speech suggests they are likely a real villager.

The Witch didn't use her poison last night, possibly fearing that No. 9 might be a real Hunter who sided with the wrong team, so she didn't rashly poison No. 9. I think this action aligns with the Witch's compassionate image, not taking life lightly. I applaud No. 3, the Witch! Yesterday's voting pattern indicates that at least one werewolf voted against the real Seer. No. 9 claimed to be the Hunter yesterday and strongly sided with the fake Seer, even accusing me, No. 7, of being a self-killing werewolf. If No. 9 is the real Hunter, I have no words for such a strategy. Given that no one else has claimed to be the Hunter against No. 9, let's hear what No. 9 has to say. If everyone wants to directly vote out No. 9 to verify the Hunter's gun, I have no objections. I just think it might be hasty to eliminate No. 9 without another Hunter claim, though I'm certainly not trying to protect No. 9. No. 4 has been carefully analyzing the situation for two consecutive rounds, and their analysis of potential werewolves aligns with mine, so I think No. 4 is likely a good person. I currently believe No. 9 is probably a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. Besides No. 6, who's pretending to be the Seer, I've narrowed down the other werewolf who voted against the Seer to either No. 1 or No. 8. I suspect No. 1 more as the werewolf who voted against the Seer. Yesterday, No. 1 thought No. 9's Hunter claim was a mistake. I believe if No. 1 were good, they wouldn't easily consider No. 9 as a werewolf, given that no one else claimed to be the Hunter. Therefore, No. 1 might be deliberately criticizing their werewolf teammate to make themselves appear innocent. This round, I will most likely vote to eliminate No. 9.",

I believe No. 1 has insight; they must either be the real Hunter or a werewolf. Since No. 1 didn't claim to be the Hunter today, they can only be the last remaining werewolf.

Although I didn't consider Player 9 to be the real hunter yesterday, no one voted for Player 9 during the exile voting phase, and I couldn't identify any werewolves in the later positions. Moreover, Seer 5 would likely be killed before me, so I chose to hold onto my poison and observe for another round. This round, I'm uncertain about the speeches from Players 8 and 9. Based on behavior, Player 9, who sided with Player 6 (who's pretending to be a seer), seems more likely to be a werewolf. Besides, Player 9 seemed to ignore my speech yesterday; I advised the hunter to stay hidden, but he immediately revealed himself. However, Player 9's passionate criticism of the good players as \"blockheads\" this round has made me waver in my judgment of whether he's a hunter or a werewolf. I can only conclude that between Players 8 and 9, one must be the hunter and the other a werewolf. For now, I can only call for a vote between Players 8 and 9, and I will cast my vote accordingly. I disagree with Player 2's accusation that Player 1 is a werewolf with information, as Player 1's analysis makes sense. Among Players 1, 2, and 4, I haven't yet figured out their identities.

From Player 9's perspective, Player 6's bad identity check on Player 2 is a werewolf, and Player 5 (who is competing with Player 6 for the seer role) is also a werewolf. Additionally, Player 9 believed on the first day that Player 7 was a werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the witch's potion. So, in Player 9's view, Players 2, 5, and 7 are the three werewolves. However, today Player 8 and Player 9 are both claiming to be the hunter. From Player 9's perspective, this would mean there's a fourth werewolf, which is impossible. This indicates that Player 9's werewolf theory has fallen apart, and Player 9 can only be a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 8 is the real hunter, and I decide to vote for Player 9.",

On the second day, they said the good team was extremely foolish and thick-headed, and ended their speech with \"Vote for me if you want.\" I believe this speech pattern might be consistent with a wrongly accused Hunter, as it's unlikely for a Werewolf to speak like this. However, if Player 9 is the real Hunter, they shouldn't have ignored my advice yesterday to \"keep the Hunter's identity hidden.\"\n\nAs the Witch in this game, I currently don't have enough information to fully assess the situation.
