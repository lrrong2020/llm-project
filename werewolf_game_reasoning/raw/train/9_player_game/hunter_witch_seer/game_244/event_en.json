If player 2 had been a good identity, it would have helped us eliminate a potential werewolf spot. However, since player 2 is a werewolf, this is also good news for us villagers. These wolf cubs like to hide among the good people, stirring up trouble with their speeches during the day, and baring their fangs to harm us at night. Fortunately, I discovered that player 2 is a werewolf! I hope the villagers present will trust my identity as the Seer and follow my lead to vote player 2 out. I will also do my utmost to find the remaining two werewolves and protect our village. I suggest that the Hunter doesn't rush to reveal themselves, but rather observe the speeches of the players present to ensure they can identify who the werewolves are. Don't reveal your identity carelessly to avoid being targeted by the werewolves. I advise the Witch to carefully examine the speech of the player they saved, as the werewolves might have attempted to kill one of their own to defraud the potion. Make sure the saved player is truly a villager before coming forward with information.",

I trust No. 3 is the Seer, and No. 2 is a werewolf. I vote to eliminate No. 2 today. No. 7 claims to be the Hunter. I find No. 7's speech full and demonstrating good-person thinking. No. 7 also clearly explained why they revealed their identity. I believe if No. 7 were a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, they would have prioritized putting themselves in a defensive position and openly sacrificed another werewolf. So I think No. 7 is likely the real Hunter. I suggest No. 3, the Seer, verify No. 4's identity tonight. No. 4, in an early speaking position without hearing other players' speeches, directly sided with No. 3. I think No. 4 might be a villager without information, or possibly a werewolf trying to mislead.

I suspect Players 2, 4, and 8 are werewolves, and tonight I will use my poison on Player 4. Players 4 and 8 immediately sided with Player 3 after they claimed to be the Seer, without waiting to see if anyone else would claim the role. I think Player 3 might be the real Seer, or they could be pretending to be the Seer. If Player 3 is the only one claiming to be the Seer, then Player 2 is likely the last werewolf. Player 4 mentioned in their speech that they hope the werewolves in later positions won't claim to be the Seer, which seems like they're passing a message to their werewolf teammates. Currently, I'm not sure if we have a single Seer situation. If no one else claims to be the Seer, I will vote for Player 2 and use my poison on Player 4 at night. If someone else does claim to be the Seer, I will vote based on the speeches between the competing Seers, but still use my poison on Player 4 at night.",

It seems No. 2 will choose to claim to be the Seer immediately, because if No. 2 doesn't claim, then No. 3 would be the uncontested Seer, and No. 2 would be the werewolf identified by No. 3. So logically, I would expect No. 2 to claim to be the Seer. So who is the real Seer between No. 2 and No. 3? Before hearing No. 2's speech, just listening to No. 3's speech, I think No. 3 appears to be the Seer, because No. 3 could accurately identify No. 2 as a bad identity. If No. 3 were a werewolf and No. 2 were the Seer, the probability would be extremely low. However, No. 9, a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, sided with No. 3, and No. 2 is my silver water. Therefore, I might suspect that No. 3 and No. 9 are two werewolves, with No. 9 directly pretending to be the Witch to charge for the werewolf team. So I might side with No. 2.
