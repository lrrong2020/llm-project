I can only silently pray that No. 9 wasn't the Seer, otherwise our chances of victory as the good team are very slim. I currently believe No. 9 could be either a Villager or a Werewolf. No. 1's speech was vague, so their identity is unclear for now. Tonight, I will use my healing potion to ensure a peaceful night. If I'm attacked tonight, I will use my poison on the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on their speech. I hope the Seer in the later speaking positions will give a good speech.

If player 5 had been a good identity, they could have helped me find the hidden werewolves. Unfortunately, I discovered player 5 is a werewolf. If player 5 tries to pretend to be a Seer against me, it won't have any credibility. I trust the good players here can distinguish that I'm the real Seer. If player 5 claims to be the Hunter, I ask the real Hunter in the later positions not to reveal themselves, and request the good players to vote with me to eliminate player 5. If player 5 claims to be the Witch, please don't believe them, as I've confirmed player 5 is a werewolf. Player 9 was eliminated during the night, so their identity can't be determined. Player 2, in an early position, claimed to be the Witch, which is highly credible. If player 2 were a werewolf, claiming to be the Witch in an early position would offer no benefit. Moreover, player 2 reported that the eliminated player 9 was saved by the potion, ruling out any possibility of cooperating with fellow werewolves. Therefore, I believe player 2 is the Witch. Player 1 claimed to be a villager with a vague speech, so their identity can't be determined. Player 3 claimed to be a villager and analyzed why player 2 might not be the Witch. Player 3 showed good-aligned thinking, so I believe player 3 is likely a good player. This round, please follow my lead and vote to eliminate player 5, the werewolf. If the players in later positions speak without any flaws, I'll check player 1 tonight.",

            "reason": "First, we need to distinguish between the true and false seers on the field.\n\n# Seer Identity Assessment:\nCurrently, players 4 and 5 claim to be seers. The speaking order is 4, then 5.\n- **Player 4**: Declares player 5 as a bad identity, believes player 2 is the witch, considers player 3 as good, wants to vote out player 5, and plans to check player 1 tonight. Player 4 analyzed the speeches of the players in front positions in detail and made judgments about the current situation that are largely consistent with mine. Therefore, I believe player 4 is the true seer.\n- **Player 5**: Declares player 6 as a bad identity, thinks player 2 is either the witch or a werewolf. Player 5 suggests that if player 2 is the real witch, she should use her poison on player 4 tonight. Player 5 plans to check either player 1 or 3 tonight and wants to vote out player 6. Since player 5 immediately pretended to be a seer after being declared a bad identity by player 4, I believe player 4's verification is more credible than player 5's. Therefore, I think player 5 is a werewolf.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 4 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 5**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 4.\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 5.",

            "reason": "Currently, we have a situation where two players are claiming to be the Hunter. Given that the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while the Seer cannot self-verify, we must prioritize eliminating one of the two Hunter claimants this round. This will allow us to distinguish between the real and fake Hunter, and give the two Seer claimants, players 4 and 5, one more day to report their verification information before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 6 and 7 are both claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 6: Firstly, players 4 and 5 are both claiming to be the Seer. Player 4 identified player 5 as a bad identity, while player 5, upon receiving this accusation, immediately claimed to be the Seer and identified player 6 as a bad identity. Since both player 4 and 5's speeches don't have major issues, I can only analyze based on the strength of their claims. Player 5's immediate counter-claim after being accused seems less convincing than player 4's initial claim. Therefore, I believe player 5 is pretending to be the Seer, while player 4 is the real Seer. Player 6 claimed to be the Hunter after being accused by player 5, so I think player 6 is likely the real Hunter.\n\n- Player 7: Their speech was very brief, only expressing support for player 5 and intention to vote for player 6. I believe player 7 is player 5's fellow werewolf. Since player 6 claimed to be the Hunter after being accused by player 5, player 7 is likely pretending to be the Hunter to help their werewolf teammate player 5 gain votes and deceive the villagers.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the real Hunter, and I've decided to vote for player 7.",
