Initially, I thought if no one else claimed to be the hunter after everyone's speech, then player 8 would undoubtedly be the only hunter, since player 2 was eliminated without using their gun and couldn't be the hunter. In that case, if player 8 was the real hunter and received a bad identity check, then player 7 would be pretending to be the seer. Today, we would vote to eliminate player 7. However, now player 9 has also claimed to be the hunter, so I need to distinguish the real hunter between players 8 and 9. I believe player 8's claim to be the hunter is quite strong because they were the second to speak. If player 8 were a werewolf, they would surely know that the real hunter would speak later. In this case, it would be risky for player 8 to falsely claim to be the hunter, and it would be better to pretend to be the witch instead, which could help locate the real witch's position. Therefore, I believe player 8 is likely the real hunter. Player 9's speech was too brief. If player 9 were the real hunter, they couldn't have failed to analyze the possibility of players 7 and 8 being a pair of werewolves. Whether player 8 is a werewolf or not has no direct connection to whether player 7 is the seer. To distinguish the real seer, we need to look at the independent speeches of both the real and fake seers. Thus, I believe player 9 doesn't have the perspective of a hunter, and player 8 is the real hunter. This means player 7, who declared player 8 as a bad identity, is pretending to be the seer. In conclusion, I will vote to eliminate player 9 this round.",

This is because the Hunter in a later speaking position would definitely claim the role, so No. 8 couldn't achieve the goal of preventing a good player from being voted out. It would be more beneficial to pretend to be the Witch instead. Therefore, No. 8 is likely the real Hunter.\n**Player No. 9**: Claims to be the Hunter after No. 8, but fails to consider whether No. 7 and No. 8 could potentially be two werewolves. This lack of perspective expected from a Hunter suggests that No. 9 is likely a werewolf.\n\n- In conclusion, I believe voting for Player No. 9 to be eliminated is the best choice.",
