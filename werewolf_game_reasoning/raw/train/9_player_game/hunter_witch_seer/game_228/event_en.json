Based on the current situation, Player 7 gave Player 8 a bad identity, and Player 8 immediately pretended to be a seer and gave Player 9 a good identity. First, let's analyze: if Player 7 is the real seer, Player 8's pretending to be a seer and giving Player 9 a good identity only benefits by elevating Player 9's status, suggesting that Player 9 might be Player 8's werewolf teammate. However, if Player 8 is the real seer, the probability of Player 7 accurately guessing Player 8 as the real seer in an earlier speaking position is not high. Secondly, Player 8 believes that Player 7 is trying to lynch the real seer (Player 8) because there are one or two werewolves among Players 1, 2, and 4. I find this reasoning illogical. Player 7 was the second to speak, so apart from Player 9 (whom Player 8 sees as good), is Player 8 assuming that Player 6 (who spoke first) is good and then judging the identities of Players 1, 2, and 4? If Player 8 is the real seer, and Player 2 is now the hunter, then Players 1 and 4 must be the two werewolves. Player 7 is a werewolf in Player 8's eyes, so Player 8 should be able to identify all three werewolves just by their claims and speeches, without needing to check the identities of Players 1, 2, and 4. However, my hidden identity is a villager, not Player 7's werewolf teammate. Therefore, I believe Player 8's logic is confused and unreasonable, unlike a real seer. I choose to side with Player 7 as the seer and vote for Player 8. I suggest Player 7 check Player 9's identity tonight, as I suspect Player 9 might be a werewolf.",
