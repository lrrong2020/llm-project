Besides me, four other players claim to be villagers: No. 2, 3, 4, and 7. Among them, there should be two villagers and two werewolves. Therefore, No. 6 claiming to be the Witch is likely the real Witch, and No. 8 claiming to be the Hunter is also likely the real Hunter.\n- Among the four players claiming to be villagers, No. 2 was declared as a bad identity by No. 1, while No. 3, 4, and 7 all sided with No. 1. This means No. 2 has no teammates and doesn't know No. 3, 4, and 7. Since we know there must be werewolves among No. 3, 4, and 7, I deduce that No. 2 is logically isolated as a good player.\n- Given that I believe No. 2 is good, I judge that No. 1, who declared No. 2 as a bad identity, is a werewolf.\n\n# In conclusion, I decide to vote for No. 1.",

The speaking order is No.1, then No.9.\n\n- **Player No.1**: Player No.1 was the first to claim the Seer role, reporting No.2 as a bad identity. I believe No.2's defense is inadequate, as they only stated that No.1 is a werewolf card without analyzing No.1's motive for giving No.2 a bad identity. From my perspective, No.2 might be a werewolf intentionally hiding their identity, so No.1, who gave No.2 a bad identity, is likely to be the real Seer.\n\n- **Player No.9**: Reports No.8 as a good identity. No.9 believes that among the players who claimed to be villagers in the earlier positions - No.2, No.3, No.4, No.5, and No.7 - there are two werewolves. However, No.2 received a bad identity from No.1. If No.9 were the Seer, they would likely consider No.2 as a good player from their perspective. But No.9 still thinks No.2 might be a werewolf. Therefore, I believe No.9 lacks the Seer's perspective and is most likely pretending to be the Seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I will support No.1 as the Seer and vote for player No.2, who was identified as a bad identity by No.1.",

Firstly, as the first speaker with 8 players yet to speak after him, if player 1 were a werewolf pretending to be a seer, it wouldn't be easy to successfully challenge the real seer by declaring player 2 (who hasn't spoken yet) as a bad identity. Secondly, by declaring player 2 as a bad identity, if player 1 were a werewolf, he would directly lose player 2's vote during the voting phase, which is disadvantageous for defending against the lynching of good players. I believe that if player 1 were a werewolf pretending to be a seer, this behavior would have no benefit, so player 1 should be the real seer.\n- **Player 9**: Player 9 claims to be the seer and declares player 8 as a good identity. Player 9's speech has no obvious logical flaws.
