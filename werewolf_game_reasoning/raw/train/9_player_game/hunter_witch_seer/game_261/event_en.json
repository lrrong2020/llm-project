Given that the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, while the Seer cannot self-verify, we must prioritize eliminating one of the two claimed Hunters this round. This will allow us to distinguish between the real and fake Hunter, and let the two Seers (players 6 and 9) report one more day of verification information before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 4 and 7 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 4: Claims to be the Hunter, no additional information. I analyze that if player 4 were a werewolf, there would definitely be a real Hunter in a later speaking position who would stand up and attack player 4. This would put player 4 in a vulnerable position, essentially sacrificing a werewolf. Therefore, I believe player 4 is the real Hunter.\n\n- Player 7: Claims to be the Hunter, believes players 4 and 6 are werewolves, and wants to vote out player 4. Player 7 claimed to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity by player 6. This is less credible than player 4, who claimed the Hunter role in the first speaking position. Thus, I believe player 7 is a werewolf forced to pretend to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 4 is the real Hunter. I decide to vote for player 7.",
