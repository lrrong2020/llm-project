I can't define Player 2's identity yet, as Player 8, being a werewolf, might be playing the trick of a werewolf identifying another werewolf as bad. So tonight, I will verify Player 2's identity. Player 8, who's pretending to be the Seer, doesn't say much, just a few words. How can the good team trust you? Player 5's speech is acceptable, seeming like a diligent villager. Player 7's evaluation of Player 5 is also objective. Player 7, being in the golden position to pretend to be the Seer, chose not to and instead objectively evaluated Player 5's identity. I think Player 7 is more likely to be on the good side. So, if the Witch has a healing potion, she must save me tonight. I will reveal Player 2's identity information tomorrow. If Player 2 is verified as bad, then we've identified all three werewolves. To avoid any controversy, I will definitely vote for my bad identity, Player 1, today.

I don't even want to comment on the weak and short speech from player 8, who is pretending to be a Seer. After all, players 8 and 9, both werewolves, are playing a little trick of lynching each other. Do you werewolves think these petty tricks can fool the upright good players? Player 8's speech is clearly meant to highlight player 9, thus elevating 9's status. Then player 9 will throw a bad identity check at one of the three remaining players in the later positions - 1, 2, or 4 - to challenge the real Seer! Since there are only three players after 9, the chance of successfully challenging the Seer is very high. If the good players side with 9 just because I've been challenged, I can't accept that. Tonight, I will check one of the outer position players. I hope players 4, 5, and 7 in the outer positions can discern the situation and not be led by the nose by these two evil wolves, 8 and 9. Either player 3 or 6 must be the Witch who was forced to use the poison after being targeted. I just hope the poison hit a werewolf, otherwise if we vote incorrectly this round, we'll lose everything! Today, let's not split our votes. We should all vote to eliminate player 9.

My speech will surely move all the good players, while yours will only incite public anger. I call on all good players to vote with me to eliminate Player 8. I think Player 5's speech as the first to speak was a bit lackluster, but being the first speaker, we can be more tolerant. I believe Player 5 is good. Player 8 directly assumed Players 5 and 7 are good, because as a werewolf with night vision, Player 8 must have seen their good identities and wants to secure their votes. So I believe Player 7 is a good player not on the same side as Player 8. As for who between Players 1 and 9 is the real seer, I haven't figured it out yet. I think among the three claiming to be seers, two must be werewolves, so we can eliminate all of them. Player 1 gave me a good identity, whether you're the real seer or not, you should vote for Player 8 with me today, because I'm your confirmed good player. I'm clearly voting for Player 8 today.

Player 8 has already claimed to be the seer in the early speaking order. If Players 9 and 8 were both werewolves, Player 9 wouldn't need to take the risk of identifying the witch or hunter as a bad identity. Therefore, Players 8 and 9 are likely not on the same team, and the real seer is either Player 8 or 9.\n- Based on this analysis, Player 1 is likely an independent werewolf. Since Player 1 was identified as a bad identity by Player 9, it's highly probable that Player 9 is the real seer.\n- I believe the reason Player 1 chose to claim to be the seer after Player 8's claim is that Player 8's speech as a werewolf pretending to be a seer was too brief to gain the trust of the good players. Therefore, Player 1 was forced to immediately claim to be the seer after being identified as a bad identity.\nThrough this analysis, I conclude that Players 1 and 8 are werewolves, and Player 9 is the seer.

However, No. 8 didn't explain why, as a villager, they initially claimed to be the seer and gave a bad identity to No. 2. I analyze that No. 8 and No. 9 are the two werewolves. If No. 8 hadn't abandoned their seer claim, either No. 8 or No. 9 would definitely be voted out this round. Therefore, No. 8 chose to abandon their seer claim to support No. 9, who is also a werewolf.\nThus, I conclude that No. 8 and No. 9 are werewolves, and No. 1 is the real seer. Based on this analysis, I decide to vote for player No. 8.",
