I knew that with great responsibility comes great duty, and I must first eliminate all the werewolves. Thus, I transformed into a hunter. But when I checked, there was only one bullet left in the gun. My heart was filled with anxiety at that moment. With three werewolves, I must hit one with perfect accuracy. However, the cunning werewolves are currently hiding among the good people, and I can't distinguish who is a werewolf yet. Today, during the day, I saw three players come forward. The first player told me he was a villager. After much consideration, I don't think the first player is a werewolf, after all, the first player is also my original form before transformation, so I can accept that player 1 is a villager. The second player told me that player 6 is a werewolf card. My gun told me, \"I only have one bullet, and I can't distinguish if player 6 is a werewolf yet, so don't shoot.\" I agree with the gun's idea; regardless of player 6's identity, I won't shoot \"it\" for now. The third player's speech also claimed to be my original form, believing that player 2 is forcefully accusing player 1. At this point, my gun told me that this third player's speech is that of a werewolf who is stalling and going in circles, ready to eliminate \"it\". I also feel that the third player's speech is that of a werewolf, and my gun is already aimed at the third player. Let's listen to the following speeches! My \"gun\" and I will carefully listen to your speeches!",

I ask you, Number 4, can your gun actually talk? Are you treating your gun as a person? Since there's a delusional werewolf pretending to be the Hunter against me, today's not about the true or false Seer. You, Number 4, dare to wear my Hunter's clothes, so you must be eliminated! The speech from Number 1 in the front position was indeed strange. Number 1 believes last night was a peaceful night, likely because the Witch used her healing potion. Would the werewolves really not kill anyone on the first night? I suspect Number 1 is deliberately acting like an ignorant werewolf. Number 2's comments about Number 1 were very pertinent! Number 3 immediately defended Number 1 and accused Number 2 of forcefully attacking Number 1. I believe there's a 50% chance that Number 3 is a werewolf. For now, I'm leaning towards supporting Number 2 as the Seer. Let's hear Number 6's statement and the speeches from the players in later positions who also claim to be the Seer.

However, the despicable Werewolf Player 2 just happened to declare me, the Seer, as having a bad identity, which immediately ruined my mood! Player 2 has spoiled my good mood and must pay for their actions! I'm telling the good players, Player 2 is pretending to be a Seer! I believe that for Player 2 to accurately challenge me, there are likely two werewolves after Player 2's position. Therefore, I think Player 1, who spoke before Player 2, is probably good. Player 3's speech suggested that Player 2 was strongly attacking Player 1, so I believe Players 2 and 3 are not on the same team, making Player 3 likely good. As for Players 4 and 5 both claiming to be the Hunter, I believe Player 4 is the real Hunter, while Player 5 is a werewolf. The reason is that Player 5 sided with Player 2, who is pretending to be the Seer, and attacked Players 1 and 3, whom I consider good. If the good players want to vote for one of the players claiming to be the Hunter, I can't stop you, but as the Seer, I will definitely vote for Player 2, who is pretending to be the Seer!",

I choose to support Player 6 as the Seer for the following reasons:\n\nPlayer 5 thinks Player 1 is a werewolf. Based on Player 5's perspective, they claim to be the Hunter, and Player 4 is the werewolf pretending to be the Hunter against Player 5. So in Player 5's view, Players 1 and 4 are definitely werewolves. Player 5 also softly supports Player 2, while Player 6 claims Player 2 has a bad identity. This would make Player 6 a werewolf in Player 5's eyes. So according to Player 5, Players 1, 4, and 6 are all werewolves, but Player 5 also thinks Player 3 has a 50% chance of being a werewolf. Based on Player 5's logic, there are too many werewolf suspects, as it's impossible to have 4 werewolves in the game.\n\nTherefore, I deduce that Player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, Player 4 is the real Hunter, Player 5 supports Player 2 while attacking Players 1 and 3. I believe Player 2 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, Players 1 and 3 are villagers that Players 5 and 2 are trying to frame, and Player 6 is the real Seer that Player 2 (werewolf) is trying to eliminate.\n\nHowever, since both Players 4 and 5 claim to be the Hunter this round, and because voting for a Hunter allows them to reveal their identity card to prove themselves, I will prioritize voting for Player 5, whom I believe is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. Even if my judgment is wrong and Player 5 is the real Hunter, they can still prove their identity by shooting Player 4, who is also claiming to be the Hunter.\n\nPlayer 7 is a clever villager, and I cast my vote for Player 5.",

It's not hard to see from player 4's speech that they are a frenzied werewolf. Player 5's speech was very concise, not only brief but also very accurate, so I believe player 5 is the Hunter. Players 2 and 6 both claim to be the Seer, and I might side with player 2 because there's an iron logic in Werewolf: \"When two players claim to be the Hunter, we need to verify the gun.\" However, player 6 insists on voting out player 2, which seems like a werewolf eager to eliminate the Seer. Player 7's speech is even more ridiculous, believing that player 6 is the Seer, but player 6 is voting for player 2 to be eliminated, while you, player 7, are voting for player 5. This gives me the impression that the werewolf team hasn't reached an agreement during the day - player 6 is rushing to vote out the Seer (player 2), while player 7 is hurrying to vote out the Hunter (player 5). I think the werewolves have already started their charge in this game. The early positions, players 1 and 3, might both be good people, while the werewolf suspects are players 4, 6, and 7. I implore the good people to consider the current situation. As the Witch, I cast my vote for player 4.",

Assuming they could be a good player who blocked the werewolf's kill from a later position, I won't speculate on their specific identity for now. No. 6 stated that No. 2, a werewolf, coincidentally identified him as the Seer, making it difficult for him to reveal his identity. This emotional state doesn't seem like an act, but rather a natural reaction from a real Seer, so I believe No. 6 is the Seer. However, we definitely can't vote for No. 2 or No. 6 today, because No. 4 and No. 5 are both claiming to be the Hunter, which changes the elimination order. Voting within the Seer's circle is no longer appropriate. Regarding the likelihood of No. 4 and No. 5 being the Hunter, I think No. 5 is more probable. As No. 5 mentioned, No. 4's speech was confusing, and I couldn't understand what they were talking about. I don't have any bias towards the player I saved, so I will vote for No. 4. Currently, I suspect No. 2 and No. 4 to be werewolves. I'm the last Witch to speak, so you may not trust my identity, but I urge the good players not to split their votes. Don't vote for the Seer candidates; instead, focus your votes between No. 4 and No. 5!",

In my view, the potential werewolves are No.2, No.5, and No.8. If No.5 were a good guy, there would be no need to compete with Hunter No.4 for the Hunter identity, so No.5 can only be a werewolf. Yesterday, No.9's speech indicated that No.8's claim of being saved by the Witch was incorrect, but No.9 didn't analyze No.8's specific identity. Moreover, in the previous round's voting phase where Hunters were competing, No.9 voted for No.4 among the two players (No.4 and No.5) claiming to be the Hunter, instead of splitting the vote to an outsider. From this, I deduce that No.9 is unlikely to use the poison on No.8, who is competing for the same role, but rather on No.5, who is competing with No.4 for the Hunter role. Using reverse logic, if we assume No.9 is a werewolf and No.8 is the Witch, then No.2 would be the Seer, No.6 would be a werewolf, and No.4 would be the Hunter who has proven his identity. In a scenario where the Hunter shoots and eliminates Seer No.2, the werewolves would only need to kill Witch No.8 at night, resulting in all three special roles being eliminated. If No.5 were a werewolf, there would be no need for self-sacrifice. Therefore, the logic of No.8 being the Witch doesn't hold up, and No.8 can only be a werewolf. This round, I vote for No.8.",

Based on this, let's analyze the situation.\n\n# Analysis and identification of the true and false Witches:\nPlayers 8 and 9 both claim to be the Witch.\n- Player 9's statement yesterday indicated that \"Player 8's good identity claim wasn't accurate, possibly because they were in a low-priority position trying to avoid being killed. I won't focus on their specific identity for now.\" Also, in the previous round's voting for the Hunter role dispute, Player 9 voted for Player 4 among the two players (4 and 5) claiming to be the Hunter, instead of splitting votes with players in later positions.\n- Based on Player 9's speech and voting behavior, it's highly unlikely that they would poison Player 8. Instead, they probably poisoned Player 5, the werewolf who was competing with Player 4 for the Hunter role, which aligns with the information about Players 5 and 9's deaths.\n- Let's analyze if Player 8 could be the real Witch: If Player 9 is a werewolf, then Player 8 is the Witch, which would mean Player 6 (who identified Player 8 as a bad identity) is pretending to be a Seer, and Player 2 is the real Seer.\n- In the scenario where Player 4 (Hunter) shot Player 2 (Seer), the only remaining special role would be Player 8 (Witch). The werewolf team would certainly kill Player 8 (Witch) rather than having Player 5 (werewolf) kill themselves.\n- Therefore, the logic of Player 8 being the Witch doesn't hold up. Player 8 can only be a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, which means Player 9 is the real Witch, and Player 6 is the real Seer.\n\n# What I should do now:\n- **Vote for Player 8**: Because Player 8 is the werewolf identified by Player 2, the real Seer I've chosen to support.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 8.",
