You criticize players 3 and 4 for being evasive, but isn't your speech just as evasive? Players 1, 2, and 9 haven't spoken yet. If another seer steps forward later, I'll believe the later seer. If there's a bad identity revealed, we should vote to eliminate that player first, then vote out player 5 tomorrow. If there's no bad identity revealed, we should vote out player 5 today.

I believe that Players 7 and 8 were eliminated last night because the Witch was killed and poisoned another player. I hope the poison was used on a werewolf; if it was used on a good player, we've already lost this game. Since both the Hunter and the Seer have now revealed themselves, even if we vote out a werewolf every round, our elimination speed can't keep up with the werewolves' killing speed.

They likely guessed that either Player 7 or 8 was the eliminated Seer, so both werewolves openly pretended to be the Seer to ensure one of them solidifies the Seer's identity. Player 5 deliberately pretended to be the Seer without reporting any identity checks, infinitely elevating the possibility of Player 1 being the Seer, while also infinitely compressing the survival space of Player 2 (me), who they suspect might be the Seer but hasn't spoken yet. Fortunately, I'm not the Seer. I can only say that the werewolf team's strategy this game is quite \"fresh.\" As a villager, I won't disrupt the good team's perspective, so I won't complain about the Seer not speaking up or about Player 7 or 8 possibly being the Seer. Instead, I choose to give a clear speech to gain the trust of the good team. You may not believe I'm a villager, but Player 2, as a villager, implores the good players present to vote for Player 5, the werewolf, to be eliminated this round. The Seer would definitely report their identity checks, so voting Player 5 out is certainly easier. Player 5 must be pretending to be the Seer. I believe Players 7 and 8 are the eliminated Witch and Seer.",

Moreover, Player 5, speaking in an early position, even called for votes against Player 1. This clearly indicates that Players 1 and 5 are werewolves who met during the night.\n- Since Player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer who deliberately doesn't report any verification, their purpose is to increase the possibility of Player 1 being the \"real seer\". Therefore, voting out Player 5 might be easier than voting out Player 1. Additionally, more players in the game consider Player 5 to be a werewolf, so the probability of voting out Player 5 is higher.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 5.",

However, Player 3 was killed tonight, which indicates that Players 1 and 5 are not both werewolves, and Player 1 is the real Seer. If Player 4 had been killed and the game didn't end, it would also indirectly prove that Player 1 is the true Seer. The werewolves killed Player 3 last night, probably because Player 1 said they would check Player 3. Player 3 was a good person, and the werewolves killed them to make the Seer report an ineffective good identity, thus reducing the survival space for the good team. I suggest we vote to eliminate Player 5, the werewolf, today.",

The reason I claimed to be the Seer without revealing my verification was to conceal my identity for one round. Since players 7 and 8 were eliminated on the first day, from the werewolves' perspective, the Seer could have been among them. So I wanted to play against the werewolves' logic by claiming the Seer role without reporting any verifications, making them think I was just a good player trying to draw their attack.\n\nIf I had rashly voted for Number 1 yesterday, my identity as the Seer might have been exposed to the werewolves. So I could only abstain and wait until today to reveal my verification information. Now, seeing the death report for the second day, I've reached this conclusion: With Number 3 dead today, it means either Number 7 or 8 was the Witch. Of course, there's a tiny chance that Number 3 was the Witch, but I still believe Number 3 was most likely a villager.\n\nI almost forgot to mention yesterday's verification information. On the first night, I identified Number 1 as a bad identity, but I didn't claim to be the Seer then. On the second night, I verified Number 4 as a good identity. Although Number 4 claimed to be the Hunter yesterday, they could also be a good player trying to draw attacks, a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, or the real Hunter. I won't blindly believe someone's identity just because of what they claim. Since I verified Number 4 as good, today Number 4 is the Hunter.\n\nMy speaking order today isn't ideal, and I don't know if you'll believe me after all these explanations. But I know that no matter what I say, you probably won't vote for Number 1 anymore. So I ask the good players not to vote for me or Number 1. Today, let's focus on choosing between Number 6 and Number 9. The last werewolf can only be one of these two, but I don't know which one it is.",
