Player 8 claimed to be the Hunter in an early position. I believe if Player 8 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to be the Hunter when there's no Seer competition, so I think Player 8 is likely the real Hunter. Player 9's speech was too brief, possibly a villager or werewolf trying to lay low. I find Player 1's speech consistent with a good player's perspective, showing proper reasoning, and aligning with my analysis of the previous players' identities, so I believe Player 1 is good. Player 2's speech was very similar to Player 1's. I think Player 2 might be a werewolf copying Player 1's style, or possibly a good player without any special role. Player 3 claimed to be the Witch, and currently, no one else has claimed this role. If Player 3 were a werewolf, the real Witch wouldn't need to reveal themselves and could simply poison Player 3 at night. I'm grateful to Player 3, the Witch, for saving my life last night, giving me the chance to speak. I trust that Player 3 is the Witch.

What's worse, some players in later positions were actually deceived. I don't know if those who believe Player 8 is the Hunter are good people or Player 8's fellow werewolves, but I hope you can see the situation clearly! If Player 8 were the Hunter, claiming to be the Hunter in the first position would not benefit the good team, it would only help the werewolves locate the Hunter and kill them at night. In other words, even if I were a werewolf, I wouldn't need to pretend to be the Hunter since Player 8 has already claimed that role. Doing so would only expose my werewolf identity. Whether I (Player 5) or Player 8 is eliminated, the werewolf team would likely lose a member. For the werewolf team, my recklessly pretending to be the Hunter wouldn't give us an advantage. I would only need to kill the Hunter at night, letting Player 8 shoot randomly or simply not kill Player 8, rendering them unable to use their gun. In conclusion, I, Player 5, am the real Hunter!\n\nBased on the previous speeches, I think Player 9 is giving vague statements and could be either a villager or a werewolf. Player 1's speech shows good-person logic; although they believe Player 8 is the Hunter, I think Player 1 is likely a villager. Player 2 thinks Player 1 is good and Player 9 is a werewolf; I believe Player 2 is either a werewolf or a villager. Player 3 claims to be the Witch and says they saved Player 4; for now, I consider Player 3 to be the real Witch. Player 4 claims to be the Seer and says I (Player 5, the Hunter) have a bad identity, so Player 4 is undoubtedly a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n\nTo the real Seer: if you've verified a good identity, you don't even need to reveal yourself. I, Player 5 the Hunter, will be eliminated and take down Player 4, the fake Seer werewolf. You can verify another player tonight. But if you, my great Seer, have identified a werewolf, feel free to reveal yourself boldly!\n\nThis round, I, Player 5 the Hunter, vote for Player 8, the werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. Your gun surely has no bullets!",

Today, there are mysteriously four villagers on the field, which means that werewolves \"disguised as villagers\" have infiltrated our village! Player 9's speech was very vague, and Players 1 and 2 think Player 9 is a werewolf. I believe Players 1 and 2 are not two werewolf cards attacking Player 9. When werewolves invade our village, villagers will certainly work together to exile them, so I think Players 1 and 2 are villagers. Since I'm a villager, I believe Player 9 is a werewolf card. I suggest that the witch protecting our village should poison this werewolf, Player 9, during the night! Player 4, as the witch's saved target, pretended to be a seer and declared Player 5 as a bad identity. As a result, Player 5 claimed to be a hunter. I think Player 5's credibility is lower than Player 8's, after all, you, Player 5, were identified as a bad identity. In my eyes, you, Player 5, can only be a werewolf pretending to be a hunter. You might as well have pretended to be a seer on the spot! After all, Player 4 was saved by Player 3, the witch, so I believe you, Player 5, are a werewolf.

If Player 9 had turned out to be good, I could have reasonably suspected Player 8 based on probability. Unexpectedly, I caught Player 9 as a big bad wolf! Player 8 claimed to be the Hunter in the first position, with an extremely brief speech. Although in a prime position to lay low, I can't give Player 8 much tolerance. In contrast, Player 5 claimed to be the Hunter with a well-reasoned speech, carefully analyzing the situation and commenting on each player. This is the behavior of someone working for the good team, and I believe Player 5 is the real Hunter! Player 9, the werewolf, first claimed to be a villager, then stated they couldn't judge if Player 8 was the Hunter or not. This is clearly a werewolf trying to avoid becoming the focus by laying low, hoping to hide their identity! I believe a villager should openly and honestly express their trust in Player 8 as the Hunter, or directly present reasonable and strong evidence against Player 8, rather than being hesitant to take a stance. This is the biggest flaw in Player 9's speech, and it also shows that Players 8 and 9 are two werewolves who dare not attack each other! Addressing Player 1, your guess is entirely correct. Player 9 is indeed that low-profile werewolf, as confirmed by my Seer ability. Player 2's thoughts align with mine, so I think Player 2 is likely good. Player 3 claimed to be the Witch. Since the Witch has a poison potion, werewolves wouldn't dare to pretend to be the Witch and risk being poisoned, so I trust Player 3's Witch identity. Player 4 pretended to be a Seer and gave a bad identity to Player 5, the Hunter. I can only say that you, Player 4, have made a mistake in your accusation and your days are numbered! Player 4 suspected Player 2's identity but didn't mention who they would check tonight, which is typical of a werewolf who doesn't dare to attack other players. My werewolf suspects are almost complete: Players 4, 8, and 9 are the three werewolves. To avoid any unexpected situations, I will check Player 6's identity tonight. Today, please vote between Players 5 and 8. If Player 8 is eliminated, they definitely won't be able to use the Hunter's shot, while Player 5 is the true Hunter in my heart. However, as the Seer, to respect my own information, I will vote for Player 9, who I am certain is a werewolf!",

However, when two players claim to be the hunter, we must eliminate one of them on the first day. This is because the hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, while the seer cannot. Therefore, we need to prioritize resolving the true and false hunter issue on the first day, allowing the two seers to report their verification information for one more day before making a decision.\n\nCurrently, players 5 and 8 claim to be the hunter, with the speaking order being 8 then 5. However, I cannot distinguish between their claims for the following reasons:\n\n- **Player 8**: As an early speaker claiming to be the hunter, I believe that if 8 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in pretending to be a hunter when no one has claimed to be a seer. Therefore, 8 might be the real hunter.\n\n- **Player 5**: Although 5 claimed to be the hunter after 4 reported a bad identity, 5's speech was generally more comprehensive than 8's. Player 5 commented on every player who spoke before them, which aligns with the perspective of a real hunter analyzing the overall situation after receiving a bad identity report.\n\nAs a villager in this game, I currently don't have enough ability to discern the situation. Regarding players 5 and 8, I can't determine which one is the werewolf. If we mistakenly eliminate a villager, it would be extremely detrimental to the villager team.\n\nTherefore, I decide to abstain from voting this round.",
