However, player 5 didn't explain their thought process for verifying player 6, nor did they define the identities of the eliminated players 3 and 9. I think player 5's speech doesn't align with a Seer's perspective and lacks the typical Seer's reasoning. They might be a werewolf deliberately giving a bad identity to challenge the real Seer. Player 5 said if no one else claims to be the Seer later, there's no need to analyze whether the eliminated players 3 and 9 include the real Seer, implying they are the true Seer. Player 5 probably saw that both eliminated players 3 and 9 are good, and fears that the real Seer might be among the eliminated players, which is why they're making such an artificial statement. As the Hunter, I'm leading the vote today. All good players should follow me and vote to eliminate player 5.\"",

I believe the witch would only use poison to prove their identity if they were killed, so either Player 3 or Player 9 must be the witch who was killed and poisoned another player. In my opinion, both Player 5 and Player 6's speeches were ordinary, so I can only analyze based on the strength of their claims. After all, Player 5 gave Player 6 a bad identity, and Player 6 immediately pretended to be a seer. Logically, Player 5's claim is stronger. How often do werewolves accurately challenge the real seer? Although Player 5 didn't present any brilliant logic, Player 6's speech didn't impress me either; their speaking performances were similar. As for Player 8 claiming to be the witch, I don't really believe it. Can Player 8 determine that Player 5 doesn't have a seer's perspective just because Player 5 didn't comment on eliminated players? Why should a seer in the first speaking position focus too much on eliminated players' identities? If they did analyze eliminated players' identities, wouldn't others attack the seer for paying attention to eliminated players? I think Player 8 is strongly attacking Player 5 and is likely a werewolf pretending to be the witch. Player 7 claimed to be the hunter and also strongly attacked Player 5, but as a villager, I can only temporarily trust Player 7's hunter identity. If no one in the later positions claims to be the hunter today, I will side with Player 5 and vote for Player 6.",

No.7, speaking after them, immediately sided with No.6, which makes me think No.7 isn't the Hunter but more likely No.6's werewolf teammate rushing to support. No.8 claimed to be the Witch and also voted for No.5, so I suspect No.8 might be a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.
