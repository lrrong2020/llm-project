So I believe Number 4 is a werewolf, and Number 2 is the seer. Number 2's speech, both in logic and eloquence, is breathtaking. His speech is smooth and natural, with precise wording and strong persuasiveness. It's convincing and passionate, showing he's willing to put his life on the line to fight against Number 4, the werewolf, to the end. He's exactly the legendary seer I have in mind.

Player 5's speech makes me suspect they might be a werewolf, so I will definitely check Player 5's identity tonight. I don't understand why people think Player 2's speech was convincing. Also, if I were a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, why would I declare a dead player (Player 3) as a bad identity? So I hope the good players who speak after me won't use this point against me. From my perspective, the Witch didn't use the healing potion. Moreover, since the Witch poisoned a werewolf, they should stay hidden and not reveal themselves.

The Hunter was forced to shoot Player 6 to prove his identity. If both Players 3 and 6 were good, the werewolves would have already gained control of the votes. However, since I haven't seen any signs of werewolves controlling the votes yet, I believe there's likely a werewolf among Players 3 and 6.\n\nThere's an issue with Player 2's speech. They didn't immediately report their verification results but first analyzed the identities of eliminated players. I think Player 2 might be a werewolf who wasn't prepared to pretend to be a seer.\n\nPlayer 4, after being declared as a bad identity, immediately became furious. This kind of indignation doesn't seem like something a werewolf could fake, so Player 4 is probably good.\n\nPlayer 5 directly attacked Player 4, claiming that if they were declared as a bad identity by the werewolves, they would pretend to be a special role to take down the fake seer, even if they were a villager. I believe that as a villager, one shouldn't falsely claim special roles and confuse other good players. Player 5 is forcefully attacking Player 4 and strongly siding with Player 2, so I can only conclude that Players 2 and 5 are two werewolves on the same side!\n\nI'm siding with Player 7. Their analysis aligns perfectly with my thoughts. Today, I will follow Seer 7's lead and vote for Player 2, who I believe is pretending to be a seer.",

A naive thought crossed my mind: \"3 and 8, one must be evil.\" I assumed either Player 3 or 8 was a werewolf. Since Player 8 was attacked, I impulsively poisoned Player 3. It turns out Player 8 was the Hunter, who shot Player 6 upon death. Player 6's identity remains unknown. I still have my healing potion. The werewolves can try to attack me tonight. If they don't, I'll ensure tomorrow is a peaceful night! Players 2 and 7 both claim to be the Seer. I'm more inclined to believe Player 7 is the true Seer. If Player 7 were a werewolf, there'd be no need to declare Player 3 as having a bad identity, especially since Player 3 is already out. Moreover, Player 7's speech aligns with a villager's perspective, showing logical reasoning consistent with my analysis of potential werewolf positions. This round, as the Witch, I vote for Player 2 as a werewolf. The likely werewolves are Players 2, 3, and 5.",
