No. 1 claims to be the Seer but offers no comment on No. 4, whom they've identified as a good identity in their perspective of a pretend Seer. I believe No. 1 lacks the Seer's viewpoint. Moreover, No. 3, upon receiving a good identity from No. 1, immediately claims to be the Witch and sides with No. 1. I think No. 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch to support their teammate. Since the Witch didn't use the healing potion last night, they currently have both potions. I believe the Witch wouldn't reveal their identity unless absolutely necessary, as it would expose them to the werewolves and make them a target. So, No. 3 can't be the real Witch. Therefore, I believe No. 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and No. 1, who gave No. 3 a good identity, is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.

Moreover, Player 1's supposed good identity, Player 3, immediately claimed to be the Witch and strongly supported Player 1 as the Seer.
