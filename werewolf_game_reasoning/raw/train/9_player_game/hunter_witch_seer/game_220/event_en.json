The Witch showed no mercy and didn't choose to save Hunter No. 2 to ensure a peaceful night. Instead, she stood by and poisoned No. 5. Hunter No. 5, to prove his identity, shot No. 1, leaving both No. 1 and No. 5's identities undefined. I believe No. 7 is likely a werewolf. No. 4 merely discussed the objective information from last night, yet No. 7 thought that No. 4's initial speech about the eliminated players' identities was unnecessary for a werewolf to present such a perspective, thus concluding No. 4's speech was that of a good person. I think No. 7's speech doesn't align with a good person's viewpoint and lacks the reasoning of a villager. I suspect No. 4 and No. 7 are werewolves pretending to identify each other. If there were still three werewolves left, they could start block voting, but since I haven't seen any signs of that yet, I believe there are only two werewolves left - No. 4 and No. 7. I urge all good people to join me in voting to eliminate No. 7.",

Player 7 thinks Player 4 is good because Player 4 carefully analyzed the death information, but Player 8 believes Player 4 is a werewolf because Player 4 didn't claim any role. However, Player 8's speech only mentioned Player 4 being a werewolf. In Player 8's view, Player 7 defended Player 4, who is suspected to be a werewolf, so doesn't that mean Player 7 could also possibly be a werewolf? But Player 8 didn't discuss this, showing a lack of perspective which likely indicates Player 8 is a werewolf. As for Player 7's issue, as Player 9 (the villager) said, there's a possibility that Players 4 and 7 are covering for each other. From Player 7's perspective, Player 4 analyzed the death information, so Player 7 thinks Player 4 is good. But Player 6 didn't analyze anything, so why didn't Player 7 question whether Player 6 might be a werewolf? The perspective is equally lacking.

If Player 7 thinks Player 4 is good for analyzing the game situation, then Player 6's failure to do so should be seen as a werewolf in Player 7's eyes.

I believe No. 6's speech has a villager's perspective and could be either a villager or a werewolf.\n- No. 7 claims to be a villager and believes that No. 4's analysis of the situation is reasonable, arguing that if No. 4 were a werewolf, there would be no need to make such an analysis in the first speech. I find No. 7's logic relatively sound, and agreeing that No. 4 is good also aligns with No. 7's perspective. Thus, I judge No. 7 to be a villager.\n- No. 8 claims to be a villager and attacks No. 4 as a werewolf on the grounds that No. 4 didn't claim any identity. I find No. 8's reasoning weak and forced. Additionally, No. 8 didn't comment on No. 7, who believes No. 4 is good. I suspect No. 8 is likely a werewolf with a flawed perspective, trying to vote against No. 4.\n- No. 9 claims to be a villager, points out No. 8's lack of perspective, yet still considers No. 4 and No. 7 to be a pair of werewolves, voting for No. 7. From this, I judge No. 9 to be either a villager or a werewolf.\n- No. 3, speaking last, didn't claim to be the Seer. If No. 3 were a werewolf, with no one else claiming to be the Seer and No. 8 clearly stating they would support a Seer giving No. 4 a bad identity, No. 3 would likely have claimed to be the Seer and given No. 4 a bad identity to vote them out. But No. 3 didn't do this, so I judge No. 3 is likely good.\n# Werewolf probability ranking:\n- 8 > 9 > 6\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for No. 8.",
