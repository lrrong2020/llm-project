Are you playing mahjong here, No. 5? Are you treating No. 2, No. 5, and No. 8 as the honor tiles in mahjong? No. 5 is like a card that's playing mahjong while verifying people. How can you expect the good guys to believe you're the Seer? However, No. 8 received a bad identity from No. 5, but when they stood up to speak, their speech was very brief. They didn't analyze the situation on the field, seeming to have a \"laid-back\" attitude. I think No. 8 doesn't at all resemble the state of a Seer who should be indignant and passionate after receiving a bad identity! I believe No. 8 is even less convincing as the Seer than No. 5. There might be my legendary Seer appearing in the later positions! However, if no one else claims to be the Seer after me, then I can only believe that No. 5 is the Seer. After all, No. 8 immediately claimed to be the Seer after receiving a bad identity, which inherently lacks credibility, and their speech was even briefer than No. 5's. So I can't possibly believe No. 8 is the Seer. As for No. 6 and No. 9, one of them must be the Witch and the other a werewolf. We can't vote either of them out today; let them deal with each other during the night, and the truth will be revealed tomorrow.

These six players have reached a kind of \"dynamic balance.\" As the seventh speaker, I don't want to break this balance now because I want to hear how No. 3 and No. 4 will take sides regarding these two factions, in order to judge whether No. 3 and No. 4 are good or bad. As for who the real seer is, I already have an answer in mind, and I will make my stance clear during the elimination voting phase. Since the witch has a poison potion this round, the two players claiming to be the witch can settle their dispute at night. Therefore, we should vote to eliminate either No. 5 or No. 8, who both claim to be the seer. Everyone, please don't split the votes.",

Moreover, Player 8 believes Player 7 is good, implying that the remaining two werewolves are in the later positions. How could he then suggest the witch to watch and use the poison? Looking at the conflicting witch claims, I'm curious why Player 6 initially thought Player 8 was a werewolf who killed his teammate, but ended up wanting to save him. Also, how did Player 6 conclude from Player 5's speech that Player 8 is good? Maybe it's my lack of skill, but I can't understand or guess Player 6's reasoning.

No. 5 completely lacks the Seer's perspective; they are clearly a werewolf giving a bad identity during the day. No. 9's speech suggests that No. 6 and No. 8 are werewolves covering for each other. Isn't No. 9 just pretending to be the Witch because they saw the silver water Seer come out too strongly, fearing that their werewolf teammate No. 5 might fail in pretending to be the Seer and be voted out?

Their claim lacks strength, and their speech was too brief, not matching the expected reaction of a true seer being challenged by werewolves. It's more likely they're a werewolf forced to pretend to be a seer after being identified by the real seer, trying not to expose their teammates.\nBased on this, I believe player 5 is the true seer, and we'll make judgments accordingly.\n\n# Identity judgments based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 8**: A werewolf competing with player 5 for the seer role.\n- **Player 6**: A werewolf competing with player 9 (the witch) for that role.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for player 8.",

If player 6 were the witch, we couldn't identify the werewolves' target, which is impossible! I believe player 9 was the real witch who was killed without using her poison. Player 9 might have been \"too soft-hearted,\" worried that player 6 was a good person deliberately claiming to be the witch to confuse the werewolves and protect the real witch. Thus, she couldn't bring herself to poison player 6 and left the game with her poison unused. I think players 4, 6, and 8 are the three werewolves, and the voting pattern is already clear.

If player 9 was a werewolf pretending to be the witch, player 6, as the real witch, would certainly have poisoned player 9. In that case, the werewolf team would definitely have killed player 6, resulting in both players 6 and 9 dying tonight.

Yesterday, the werewolves managed to vote out 8, the seer. 9, being a werewolf, feared that witch 6 would poison werewolf 5, so they chose not to kill anyone. Even if 5 had died alone at dawn, werewolf 9 could have reasonably defended themselves! The werewolves are truly cunning. Fortunately, witch 6 had the wisdom to poison werewolf 9. The werewolves' decision not to kill anyone was because they hadn't identified the hunter yet and didn't dare to target players in later positions or witch 6, which would have exposed their true identities. I hope the good people will wake up in time and vote to eliminate werewolf 5 today.",

No. 4 claims that No. 9 is a werewolf, reasoning that if No. 9 were the real witch, she would have definitely poisoned No. 6 last night, but she didn't. No. 4 also believes that No. 9, as a werewolf, feared No. 6 might poison No. 5 (another werewolf), so they chose not to kill anyone last night. Following your logic, No. 4, why would No. 9, if they were a werewolf, choose not to kill? If I, No. 5, were a werewolf, I'd vote out the Seer and then choose not to kill - do you think all the good players have an IQ of 5 or less? If No. 9 were a werewolf and killed No. 6 at night, how could the good team distinguish between the real witch and the werewolf? So, the fact that only one player died can only mean that the witch didn't use her poison, not that the werewolves chose not to kill. I believe this was No. 9's intention as a witch - since we good players have the advantage, whether to use the poison or not doesn't make much difference. Not using the poison already proves that No. 9 is the real witch. No. 6 behind me is a werewolf pretending to be the witch. This round, we good players should follow my lead and vote out No. 4, whom I've identified as a werewolf.",
