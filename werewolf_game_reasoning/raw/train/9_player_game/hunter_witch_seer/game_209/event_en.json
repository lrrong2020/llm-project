Therefore, Player 2 might be a werewolf pretending to be the witch.

So, for now, I consider Player 2 to be either the witch or a werewolf. Player 1's speech was standard, and I can't determine their identity at the moment.

Usually, Seers tend to check players behind them, but this time I decided to do the opposite, and unexpectedly caught a big bad wolf! Last night, players 5 and 9 both died. I believe one of them might have been a Witch who was forced to use her poison to prove her identity after being attacked, killing the other player. Normally, a Witch wouldn't refuse to save someone and recklessly use poison, so I'm skeptical about player 2's claim to be the Witch. Player 1's opening speech was too vague, so I can't define their identity yet. Player 2 said that player 1 was seriously analyzing the situation with a villager's perspective, but I don't know how player 2 came to this conclusion. However, since you, player 2, are suspected to be the Witch, I won't focus on you too much this round. If you don't die tonight or if tomorrow isn't a peaceful night, then you, player 2, must be a werewolf! Player 3, a werewolf, hypocritically hopes that the Seer in the later positions will speak well because of their important responsibility. Do you, player 3, think that these pretentious words will make the villagers believe you? Today, the villagers shouldn't split their votes; we should all vote to eliminate player 3, the werewolf. To the werewolves in the later positions, if you dare to claim the Seer role, it's equivalent to suicide. But I actually hope you'll try to save your werewolf teammate, player 3.

Moreover, when player 3 pointed out this mistake, player 4 immediately accused player 3 of being a bad identity. In my view, player 4 is trying to protect player 2, so I think player 4 is a werewolf. Player 6 seems like a werewolf because he concluded that player 4 is either a werewolf or a seer, which is a meaningless statement. I'm labeling player 6 as an idle werewolf! This round, I will vote for player 4 to be eliminated. I support player 7, but I'm voting for player 4 because at least no one has challenged player 2's witch claim yet!",

The Witch should know who was killed by werewolves and who was poisoned. Secondly, Player 4 gave Player 3 a bad identity right after Player 3 attacked Player 2. In my view, this behavior is protecting Player 2, so Players 2 and 4 are likely to be a werewolf pair. Lastly, Player 6's speech was too vague and entirely pointless, which I don't consider to be good player behavior. Therefore, I believe the werewolves this round might be Players 2, 4, and 6, and I will side with Player 7. Player 7 claimed to be the Seer and gave Player 2 a bad identity. Player 2 claimed to be the Witch, but no one else contested this claim, so I might believe that Player 2 is the Witch. However, I'm certain that Player 4 is a werewolf, so I will vote for Player 4 this round.",

Player 3 voted for Player 2, who was identified as a bad identity by Player 7. Additionally, Player 3 claimed to be the hunter this round.\n- Therefore, I still agree with my opinion from the previous round that Player 4 is the most likely to be a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 4.",
