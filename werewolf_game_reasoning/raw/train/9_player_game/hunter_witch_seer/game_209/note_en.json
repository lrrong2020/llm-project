Mentions that No. 5 and No. 9 died last night, suggesting there might be a witch. Hopes neither No. 5 nor No. 9 was the seer.\n- Seems like a villager without information.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager\n\nPlayer 2:\n- Claims to be the witch. Believes No. 1 is good.\n- Likely a villager who blocked the kill. Speech lacks substantial content, impulsively claiming a role. Doesn't match the behavior of a witch who should hide after using the poison.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager\n\nPlayer 3:\n- Expresses doubt about No. 2's witch identity. Could be the hunter, as villagers usually don't question the authenticity of god roles.\nSubjective identity judgment: Hunter\n\nPlayer 4:\n- Claims to be the seer, gives No. 3 a bad identity, wants to vote for No. 3.\n- I think No. 3 is difficult to vote out, so I pretend to be a seer to support No. 4.\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf\n\nPlayer 6:\n- Claims to be a villager, gives a very vague speech, doesn't express opinions. Seems to avoid being the focus, likely the witch trying to hide their identity after using the poison to avoid being targeted by werewolves.\nSubjective identity judgment: Witch\n\nPlayer 7:\n- I claim to be the seer and give No. 2 a bad identity.\n- Because No. 2's speech is problematic, claiming to be the witch without reporting last night's poison use will cause confusion and doubt among good players. Good players are unlikely to believe No. 2 is the real witch, so the chance of successfully voting out No. 2 is high. Therefore, I choose to give No. 2 a bad identity.\n\nPlayer 8:\n- Claims to be a villager, believes werewolves are No. 2, No. 4, and No. 6. Will vote for No. 4.\n- Unwilling to vote for No. 2. Behaviorally seems to accept the witch role, but if No. 8 were the witch, they would likely believe No. 4 is the seer. If No. 2 is an unknown identity who exposed No. 8's witch identity, then No. 8 would likely show some hostility towards No. 2.\n- So No. 8 is most likely a villager.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager\n\nMy vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player No. 2.",
