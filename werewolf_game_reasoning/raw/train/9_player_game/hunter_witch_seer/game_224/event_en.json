I believe one of them might have been the Witch who was killed. Player 2 hasn't claimed any role. If Player 2 dares to claim to be the Witch, given the double death situation, the Witch is likely already out, so today we good players should work together to vote out Player 2 as a werewolf. If Player 2 dares to pretend to be a seer right away, it would have no credibility. If Player 2 dares to claim to be the Hunter, we should immediately vote them out unanimously. The real Hunter doesn't even need to reveal themselves; we can just vote out Player 2 today to prevent the werewolves from identifying the Hunter's position. If Player 2 claims to be a villager, letting their werewolf teammates defend them, it would expose two werewolves. We should vote out Player 2 today, and tomorrow we can eliminate the werewolf pretending to be the Seer. As the Seer, my duty is to use my verification ability to lead the good players to victory. After nightfall, I will check the suspected werewolf. Good players, please join me in voting out Player 2, the werewolf, today.",

Generally, a Witch wouldn't recklessly use the poison without saving anyone. So if anyone in the later positions claims to be the Witch, I'm unlikely to believe them! To all the good players, if I were a werewolf who received a bad identity check, I could easily pretend to be a villager to gain trust, allowing my werewolf teammate in a later position to pretend to be the Seer and save me. There's no need for me to claim to be the Hunter, putting myself in the spotlight and risking being shot. So I can only be the real Hunter. If anyone in later positions dares to claim to be the Hunter to save No. 1, who's pretending to be the Seer, I'll make them taste my bullet! No. 1's speech was extremely formulaic, devoid of any emotion, like a cold \"pretend Seer machine\", clearly pretending to be the Seer just for the sake of it! Today, let's unanimously vote out No. 1, the fake Seer. If the werewolves gang up to vote me out, I'll immediately shoot No. 1. To the Seer in the later positions, if you think the current situation poses no risk to you, you don't even need to reveal yourself today. You can check one more player tonight and report two nights' worth of information tomorrow. After all, the Witch is likely gone, so the werewolves will definitely target the Seer tonight!",

How could the witch still have poison on the first day when players 5 and 6 both died? So player 3 can only be a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Therefore, player 4, who was accused by player 3 of having a bad identity, is likely a good guy, which means player 8 is a werewolf. Following this logic, the eliminated players 5 and 6 must have been villagers! You three gods and three werewolves each have a role, so my identity as a villager can't be hidden anymore!
