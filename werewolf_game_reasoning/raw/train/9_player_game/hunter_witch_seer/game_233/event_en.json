However, since player 9 is a good identity, player 8 needs to automatically prove their innocence. Today, I will closely observe player 8's speech, analyzing their statements, voting patterns, and alignments to determine if they are a werewolf. Since players 5 and 6 didn't pretend to be a seer before me, I tentatively consider them both to be good players. As the Seer, my responsibility is to use my verification ability to lead the good team to victory. Tonight, I will check a suspected werewolf.

No one else claimed to be the seer afterwards, which means Player 9 is the real seer, and Players 1 and 7 are the two werewolves.

Player 5's speech was sincere, thanking the witch for using the potion, which seems like a good person's attitude. Player 6 considered the small probability of the witch saving a werewolf who killed themselves, showing thoughtful behavior like a good person. In contrast, Player 3's perfunctory speech and lack of serious analysis of the situation in the last position make me believe that Player 3 is the last werewolf.

This was to put some pressure on player 8's identity. If player 8 were a werewolf, it would have felt suppressive to them! I didn't expect player 8 to be the hunter and player 9 to be the real seer. I can only say I was born at the wrong time. I didn't anticipate that the werewolves would choose not to claim any roles, intending to frame me, player 7, a villager, for elimination. I'm sorry to the good team, I'm guilty, I shouldn't have falsely claimed to be a seer. Last night, players 2 and 9 both died. If player 2 was the real witch, they chose to side with player 9 yesterday, and would absolutely not have poisoned player 9 at night. So player 9 must be the seer who was killed by werewolves, and player 2 must be a werewolf pretending to be the witch, who was then poisoned by the real witch.

If that's the case, all our efforts have gone to waste! We had such a good position, a guaranteed win, and now we're about to lose! Now both the Seer (No. 9) and the Witch (No. 2) are out, leaving me, the Hunter, as the only special role left.

If Number 3 is indeed the Witch who poisoned Number 2, everything falls into place. Number 7 is claiming to be a villager again this round?

To No. 8 Hunter, your concern about the Witch \"accidentally\" poisoning No. 9 is completely unnecessary! No. 9 can only be the Seer killed by werewolves, while No. 2 is the werewolf poisoned by the Witch. No. 3 claims to be the Witch this round, so I believe in No. 3's Witch identity. Last round, No. 2 claiming to be the Witch might have been to confuse the good team's perspective, trying to lure out the real Witch and make it difficult for the good team to understand the situation, creating a distracting effect. But in the previous round, when No. 3 saw two werewolves, No. 1 and No. 2, both claiming to be the Witch, they decided to watch the show and didn't claim the Witch role. This is called \"the fisherman benefits when the snipe and the clam fight each other.\" I applaud No. 3's brilliant gameplay! The werewolf suspects are No. 1, No. 2, and No. 7. No. 7 claimed to be the Seer last round but was betrayed by their own good identity, and this round they've abandoned the Seer's role, clearly a panicked and weak werewolf. Let's vote out No. 7 werewolf first this round and see if the game ends. I believe we will achieve victory immediately after voting No. 7 out!",
