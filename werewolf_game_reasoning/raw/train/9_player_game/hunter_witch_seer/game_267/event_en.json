I will guide you based on my nightly verification results. Player 6 dared to claim the Hunter role in their first speech, which makes me believe they are confident in their identity. If Player 6 were a werewolf, claiming to be the Hunter in an early position would be suicidal, so I trust that Player 6 is indeed the Hunter. Player 7 claimed to be a villager with a vague speech, making their identity unclear. I will most likely check Player 7 tonight, but if there's a player in a later position who gives an even vaguer speech than Player 7, I may change my verification target for the night. Please trust me and follow my lead to vote out Player 1, the werewolf, this round. Let's work together to welcome the dawn of victory.",

In contrast, Number 8, who claimed to be the Seer, was long-winded with little valuable information. Number 8 said they would check Player 7, then immediately said they would check inactive players, contradicting themselves. Therefore, I believe Number 8 is a werewolf who kills at night and fabricates verification information during the day based on the game situation and speech order. A qualified Seer should have clear verification targets and guide the good team, not contradict themselves like Number 8. In conclusion, I think Number 8 is a werewolf, and Number 6, who is competing with Number 1 for the Hunter role, is also a werewolf. If a real Seer in a later position has a bad identity check, I will prioritize voting for that player. If not, I will vote for Player 8 today. I hope the real Seer in a later position speaks well, convincing the good team to trust them and choose the right side, not following the werewolves and voting incorrectly.

Therefore, between Players 6 and 1 both claiming to be the hunter, I believe Player 6 is the real hunter, while Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the hunter after being identified as a bad identity by Player 8. I support Player 8 as the seer. Player 2 claimed to be the witch and reported Player 1 as saved. I see two possibilities: Player 2 might be Player 1's fellow werewolf charging forward, or Player 2 is the real witch and Player 1 is a werewolf who killed himself to defraud the witch's potion.

This will allow us to distinguish the real Hunter, and let the two potential Seers (players 8 and 4) report one more day of verification information before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 6 and 1 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 6: Player 6 claimed to be the Hunter in the first speaking position. I believe if player 6 were a werewolf, there would be no need to pretend to be the Hunter in the first position, as the real Hunter would certainly speak up to challenge player 6. This doesn't align with the werewolf principle of trying to hide their identity, and there's little benefit in falsely claiming to be the Hunter in the first position. Therefore, I think player 6 is likely the real Hunter.\n\n- Player 1: Player 1 claimed to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity by player 8. In their speech, player 1 attacked player 8 for \"not explaining the thought process behind checking player 1\". I believe that a real Seer can randomly check any player's identity on the first night when there's no information available. Player 1's attempt to strongly challenge player 8 based solely on the \"thought process\" makes them seem like a werewolf who's panicking after being identified as a bad identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the real Hunter.

Given that the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while the Seer cannot self-verify, we must prioritize eliminating one of the two Hunter claimants this round. This will allow us to distinguish between the real and fake Hunter, and give the two Seer claimants (players 4 and 8) an extra day to report their verification information before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 1 and 6 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 6: Player 6 claimed to be the Hunter in the first speaking position. If player 6 were a werewolf, pretending to be the Hunter in the first position would offer no benefit to the werewolf team and would make it difficult for them to conceal their identity. Therefore, I believe player 6 is the real Hunter.\n\n- Player 1: Player 1 claimed to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity by player 8. I believe that a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity by the Seer is a common tactic for werewolves. Moreover, I've already deduced that player 6 is the real Hunter, so I think player 1 is a werewolf forced to pretend to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the real Hunter. I've decided to vote for player 1.",

I think No. 1's reason for attacking No. 8 is rather weak, because a real seer can randomly check any player's identity on the first night when no information is available. No. 1's attack on No. 8 based solely on the lack of \"thought process\" is logically flimsy and unconvincing. Therefore, I believe No. 1 is a werewolf accurately identified by No. 8.\n- In conclusion, I will vote for No. 1.",
