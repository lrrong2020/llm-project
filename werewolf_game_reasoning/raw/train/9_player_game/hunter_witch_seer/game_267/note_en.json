I believe 6 is the Hunter because 8 gave 1 a bad identity, and 1 and 6 both claim to be the Hunter. I think 8 is the Seer because 8 chose to skip me (9) and give 1 a bad identity. 8 is a convincing Seer, so 1 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, and 6 is the real Hunter.\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be a Villager, believes 6 is the Hunter. I think 7 is a Villager because 7's speech is from a non-special role perspective, likely a Villager.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be the Seer, reports 1 as a bad identity, believes 6 is the Hunter, wants to vote for 1, and will check 7 tonight. I think 8 is the Seer because 8 skipped me (9) to give 1 a bad identity, earning my trust, so I believe 8 is the Seer.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be a Villager, trusts 8 as the Seer, wants to vote for 1. I am a Villager.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the Hunter, thinks 6 and 8 are werewolves, wants to vote for 6. I think 1 is a werewolf because I believe 8 is the Seer, so 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Witch, believes 1 is the Hunter, thinks 8 is a werewolf, wants to vote for 8. I think 2 is a werewolf. 2 claims to be the Witch and says 1 is their good identity, but 2 directly believes 1 is the Hunter without analyzing if 1 could be a werewolf who killed themselves. So 2 is not the Witch, but a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be a Villager, believes 6 is the Hunter, thinks 8 is the Seer, wants to vote for 1. I think 3 is a Villager because 3 agrees with me in trusting 8 as the Seer and voting for 1. 3 has a good person's perspective.\n- **Player 4**: Claims to be the Seer, reports 2 as a good identity, wants to vote for 8. I think 4 is a werewolf because 4 listened to most players' speeches but didn't comment on the later players' speeches, showing no Seer's perspective.\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be the Witch, reports 4 as their good identity, wants to vote for 2, and use the poison on 4. I think 5 is the Witch because 5 gave 4 a good identity, while 4 claimed to be the Seer and gave 2 (who claimed to be the Witch earlier) a good identity. If 5 were a werewolf, claiming to be the Witch and giving 4 a good identity would have no benefit, so 5 is the Witch.\n\nIdentity judgments:\n**Player 1**: Werewolf\n**Player 2**: Werewolf\n**Player 3**: Villager\n**Player 4**: Werewolf\n**Player 5**: Witch\n**Player 6**: Hunter\n**Player 7**: Villager\n**Player 8**: Seer\n**Player 9**: Villager\n\nMy vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 8.",
