No. 4's speech aligns with a good person's perspective and shows proper reasoning, so I believe No. 4 is good. No. 6's speech showed no hostility towards the two who claimed to be villagers and lacked substantial content, so I think No. 6 is probably a werewolf who's not contributing much.

Player 4 didn't directly define player 3 as a passive werewolf; player 4 only thought player 3 could be either a werewolf or a villager. However, player 8 directly misrepresented player 4's speech to classify player 4 as good. I really can't understand this behavior! As a Seer, how can one so rashly use faulty logic to define other players' identities? Moreover, player 8's speech was too brief, focusing solely on player 3, without analyzing the overall situation or the potential werewolf positions. This is not the state a Seer should be in. It seems that after hearing player 8 pretend to be a seer, player 9, the werewolf, became \"desperate\". After all, based on player 8's speech, rushing to support player 8 would be equivalent to suicide. Therefore, player 9 directly turned to challenge me! Given that players 8 and 9 are now exposed as a werewolf pair, tonight I will try to find the last werewolf based on the voting situation. Today, let's not split our votes. Follow me and vote unanimously to eliminate player 9, the werewolf. Player 9 has indicated that they will vote along with the Seer in the later positions. Well, player 9, I am the Seer, and you are my bad identity. So, you should vote for yourself. This way, we good people can achieve a great victory directly!",

But isn't this too perfunctory for a Seer, given that the good team needs to choose sides based on the Seer's speech and logic? Unsurprisingly, after hearing Number 8's speech, Number 9 immediately stood up and expressed support for the later-speaking Seer. Setting aside the fact that Number 1's speech and analysis of the situation are superior to Number 8's, just based on Number 9 clearly siding with the later-speaking Seer, if Number 1 were a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, there would be no need to attack Number 9 as a werewolf. Instead, they should have pulled Number 9's vote to give a bad identity to an outer-position player. For the werewolf team, this would definitely succeed in forcing a vote against a good player. Therefore, I believe Number 1 is the real Seer, and this round I will vote for Number 9, who was identified as a bad identity by Number 1.",
