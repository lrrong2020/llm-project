This will prevent them from using the healing potion to save someone, giving us werewolves a greater advantage.\n**Strategy for the next day's speech**:\n  - With player 2 (Witch) and player 3 (Seer) already eliminated, tomorrow I will pretend to be the Hunter. As long as we find the real Hunter and vote them out or kill them at night, the werewolves can win. If we can't find the Hunter, I'll defend any villager in the later speaking positions. If we successfully protect a villager from being voted out, and then kill another villager at night, we can create a situation where the werewolves control the votes, ensuring our victory even if we don't find the Hunter.",
                    "notes": "# Objective Information\n- **Night Information**:\n  - Werewolves chose to kill No.9, but the Witch used the potion to save, resulting in a peaceful night.\n- **Day Information**:\n  - Speech order starts from No.6.\n\n# Speech and Behavior Analysis\n- **Player 6**:\n  - First to speak, claimed to be a villager, gave a vague speech.\n- **Player 7**:\n  - My werewolf teammate, pretended to be a seer and declared No.8 as good identity. Believed No.6's identity doesn't need to be defined urgently, temporarily considering No.6 as more likely a good person. Spoke sincerely, asking good people to vote for the \"pretend seer werewolf\" in later positions.\n- **Player 8**:\n  - Claimed to be a villager, believed No.6's speech was straightforward like a villager, thought No.7's speech was very convincing, and will temporarily side with No.7.\n- **Player 9**:\n  - Claimed to be a villager, believed No.8's reason for protecting No.6 was incorrect, thought No.8 was a werewolf, therefore No.7 is also a werewolf, voting for No.7 this round.\n- **Player 1**:\n  - Myself, stated that No.7's speech was average, No.9's reason for attacking No.8 was incorrect and the logic for siding was unreasonable, therefore No.9 seems more like a werewolf, will likely side with the seer in later positions.\n- **Player 2**:\n  - Claimed to be the Witch, reported No.9 as the saved player, believed No.7 and No.8 are both werewolves.\n- **Player 3**:\n  - True Seer, reported No.4 as bad identity, believed No.4 and No.7 are definite werewolves, the last werewolf is either No.5 or No.8, considered No.9 and No.1 as good people.\n  - No.3's speech has significant issues: First, the logic is confusing. Initially thought No.8's speech didn't support No.7, judging No.8 and No.7 are not on the same side, considering No.8 as good. Believed No.9 attacked No.7, so No.9 is also good. The problem is, No.9 attacked No.8 as a werewolf, how can No.3 consider both No.8 and No.9 as good? Second, why can No.3 protect both No.9 and No.1? No.1 attacked No.9, considering No.9 strongly accused No.8. If No.9 is a werewolf, on what basis does No.3 think both No.9 and No.1 are good? Third, why does No.3 baselessly attack No.5 as a werewolf? Moreover, No.3's reasons for protecting No.6 and No.9 are insufficient. Is it enough to protect No.9 just because No.9's speech attacked No.7?\n  - In summary, I believe werewolves have sufficient reasons to collectively vote for No.3, attempting to eliminate No.3, and No.8 is likely to vote for No.3.\n- **Player 4**:\n  - Werewolf teammate, after being identified as bad, claimed to be a villager, believed No.3 and No.9 are both werewolves, the last werewolf is either No.5 or No.6, voting for No.3 this round.\n- **Player 5**:\n  - Claimed to be a villager, believed No.7's speech matches the ideal seer's speech, also thought No.3's definition of No.8's identity was contradictory, therefore expressing support for No.7, will vote for No.3 this round.\n\n# Identity Predictions for This Round\n- **No.1**: Werewolf\n- **No.2**: Witch\n- **No.3**: Seer\n- **No.4**: Werewolf\n- **No.5**: Villager or Hunter\n- **No.6**: Villager or Hunter\n- **No.7**: Werewolf\n- **No.8**: Villager or Hunter\n- **No.9**: Villager or Hunter",
