I find this very convincing. If Player 9 doesn't contradict this and supports Player 6 during the sheriff election, I might believe that Player 6 is the seer and Player 9 is good. I think either Player 2 or 3 was the witch who was eliminated. As the witch is a powerful role on the good side, they wouldn't use their poison recklessly on an innocent player unless their own life was threatened. In that case, they might use it blindly to convey information. I hope the good players in the later positions will speak carefully and analyze the situation thoroughly.",

Initially, I planned to hide my Seer identity this round, posing as a villager to avoid the werewolves' attention, survive the night, and then assess whether Player 9 is a werewolf. This would potentially allow me to verify another player tomorrow night, helping to clarify the situation. But I noticed that up to Player 8's speech, no one analyzed the eliminated Players 2 and 3, except Player 9 briefly mentioning that the Witch wouldn't poison the Seer. Therefore, I'm temporarily not considering Players 6 and 9 as both werewolves, and I believe there's an 80% chance that Player 9 is a villager. I've decided to reveal my Seer identity because everyone seems to be siding with Player 6, who I believe is pretending to be the Seer. Even Player 8 thinks Players 1 and 4 are werewolves. I risk being voted out by the werewolf team this round, so as the real Seer, no matter how afraid I am, I must take on my responsibility and bravely report my verification information. Although my confirmed good player, Player 2, has been eliminated, I still need to speak up and strive to gain the trust of the good players! This is the attitude a Seer should have! Since the players who spoke before me have mostly sided with Player 6, I can't identify the werewolf hiding among the good players. But I want to address Player 4: I don't know your identity, but even if you're a werewolf, the earlier speakers have already accused you of being one, so this round you should vote with me against Player 6, who is pretending to be the Seer. I, Player 1, am the only real Seer in the game. Player 2 was my confirmed good player. I call for a vote against Player 6, who is pretending to be the Seer. Tonight, I will verify Player 8.",

Player 1's speech only appeals to me emotionally, but the logic is not impressive. Player 1 even states they originally didn't plan to claim the seer role, which is unacceptable for a real seer.

The fact that Player 6 wasn't killed last night raised big doubts in my mind. How could the werewolves not target the seer? Now we don't know how many werewolves are left. If there are two werewolves still in play, we've probably lost this round. Let's hear Player 6's verification report first. For now, I'm still siding with Player 6.",

If player 1 were a werewolf, there would be no need to pretend to be a seer in the last speaking position; they could have easily claimed to be a villager and directed votes. Player 1 claimed to be the seer because they felt the responsibility and duty of being the real seer! If you don't stand guard, and I don't stand guard, who will protect our country and our homes?

As a lone wolf, Number 5 must keep me, the real seer, alive as a target to divert votes, ensuring their own survival!

I believe there are only two werewolves left in the game. If there were three werewolves present, they would have already formed a binding vote situation and wouldn't need to keep up the act with the good people.

However, player 4 was killed by werewolves last night, while player 6 is still alive. This doesn't align with the typical werewolf killing strategy. Since the witch has been eliminated, if player 6 were the real seer, the werewolves could have easily killed player 6, then found the hunter and either voted them out or killed them. But player 6 wasn't killed, which strongly suggests they are pretending to be a seer.\n\n- In their speech, player 6 said, \"As a lone wolf, player 5 must keep me, the real seer, alive as a target for voting, so that player 5 can ensure their own survival.\" This is completely baseless. If player 5 were the only werewolf, they would definitely kill the seer directly, rather than allowing the seer to report a second round of verification, which would limit the werewolf's own chances of survival.\n\nBased on these points, I've decided to vote for player 6.",

At this crucial point, Player 7 claims that Players 6 and 9 are both werewolves, without doubting my identity at all. Surprisingly, Player 7 suggests voting for Player 9 first, even though Player 9 is a good identity confirmed by Player 6. If Player 9 were suspected of being a werewolf, Player 6 should be voted out first. This reveals Player 7's true nature as a werewolf.\n- In the previous round, Player 7 helped Player 6 to vote out Player 1, and in this round, Player 7 has been consistently protecting Player 6, preventing others from voting for them. Therefore, I believe Players 6 and 7 are both werewolves.\n- Player 6 is pretending to be a seer and trying to vote out Player 5, who is a good player. Player 6 poses a greater threat to the good team, so we should prioritize voting them out this round.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe voting out Player 6 this round is the better choice.",
