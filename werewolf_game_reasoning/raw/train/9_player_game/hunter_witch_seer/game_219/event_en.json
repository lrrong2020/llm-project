If Player 4 is a special role, they could only be the Hunter, as only the Hunter can prove their identity upon elimination. But Player 6 has already claimed to be the Hunter, and I'm inclined to believe that Player 6 is the real Hunter, while Player 4 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. Player 5 claims to be the Seer and declares Player 8 as a bad identity, believing that Player 4 is likely an inactive werewolf. Player 5 states they will verify Player 4 tonight. Addressing Player 6, Player 5 hasn't definitively labeled Player 4. To Player 5, if you are indeed the Seer, I suggest you verify players in later positions based on voting information tonight. I believe Player 4's behavior indicates they can only be the Hunter or a werewolf, so there's no need to waste your verification on them.

I hope my powerful Seer in a later position can speak well and lead the good team to eliminate the werewolves. Player 9 died alone, their identity unknown. We can first rule out the Witch, as the Witch can save themselves on the first night. It could be a good player killed by werewolves, or a werewolf killing themselves. Number 4 in an earlier position ended their speech with just a single word \"pass,\" which doesn't help the good team. So I believe Number 4 can't be on the good side and must be a werewolf. Number 6 in an earlier position claimed to be the Hunter, which is likely true, as it would be suicidal for a werewolf to claim Hunter early on. So I trust that Number 6 is the Hunter. Number 7 carefully analyzed the situation, showing a good player's perspective, so I think Number 7 is good. Now, the werewolf suspects are Numbers 4 and 5. I will follow the vote of the Seer in a later position. If their identity check reveals a good player, we'll vote for Number 5 today, and the Witch should use the poison on Number 4 tonight.

I've rarely seen a werewolf like Player 4 who only says one word \"pass\" in their speech. If Player 4 were a werewolf, wouldn't they be afraid of being criticized by their fellow werewolves for such a speech? So Player 4 seems more like a good player. Player 5 gave Player 8 a bad identity, but if they've already defined Player 4 as a werewolf, why would they still verify Player 4? Couldn't they just directly tell the witch to poison Player 4? This is where I think Player 5's speech is flawed. Player 8, after receiving the bad identity, their response seems acceptable to me. Currently, I think Player 5's speech has slight imperfections, but they're not fatal. Let's wait and compare with the speeches of the other players claiming to be the seer before taking sides.",

I think Player 4's single-word \"pass\" is quite suspicious. Such a confident and casual statement must be backed by a strong hand, so I believe Player 4 is either a special role like the Witch or Hunter, or a werewolf! Player 6 claimed to be the Hunter and sided with the later-speaking Seer while accusing Player 5 of being a werewolf, so I believe Player 6 is the real Hunter. Player 8 claimed to be a villager after being accused by Player 5, who pretended to be a Seer. I think Player 8's reaction is consistent with a good person's perspective, so I tentatively consider Player 8 to be a villager. Tonight, I will check either Player 1 or Player 3. Everyone, please join me in voting to eliminate Player 7, the werewolf, this round!",

Their thought process is self-consistent and their speech was moderate and reasonable.\n- **Player 2**: Second to last to speak, didn't explain their reasoning for verifying Player 7, and stated they might verify Player 3 tonight because Player 3 hasn't spoken yet. I think if they couldn't determine Player 1's identity from their speech, they should have suggested verifying Player 1 directly, rather than proposing to check a player who hasn't spoken yet.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe Player 5 is more likely to be the real seer.

Yesterday, Number 2 said in their speech that Number 4 was either the witch, the hunter, or a werewolf, and also stated they believed Number 6 was the hunter. This means Number 4 can't be the hunter, so they can only be the witch or a werewolf. However, last night both Numbers 1 and 2 died. If Number 4 were the witch, they wouldn't have poisoned Number 2 because the voting pattern shows that Number 4 clearly sided with Number 2. Therefore, if Number 4 were pretending to be the witch, they could only lie and say that Number 2 was killed, and Number 4 chose to poison Number 1. But if the witch had an antidote, and Number 4 saw Number 2 being killed, they would prioritize saving Number 2 rather than not saving who they believed to be the seer and directly poisoning Number 1. Even if Number 4 wanted to use the poison, they would have poisoned Number 5, who claimed to be the seer against Number 2, or Number 7, who was identified as a bad identity by Number 2.

I'm addressing Player 3 (villager) and Player 6 (Hunter). If I were a werewolf, I wouldn't simply pass; I would definitely take some action.
