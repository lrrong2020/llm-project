I'm calling for votes on player 4. Players 2 and 3 in the earlier positions both claimed to be villagers. Player 5 claiming to be the Witch is like a \"reverse good identity\", and I believe their role. Player 5 is an uncontested Witch, so we don't need to over-analyze why player 6, the Hunter, shot player 8 as the Witch, because if player 8 were the Witch, the werewolves would have already won. As they say, \"United we stand, divided we fall.\" Everyone voting for player 4 today is my ally! Addressing player 5, the Witch: you should use your poison on player 3, who's echoing my good player's speech. I suspect player 3 is a werewolf following others.
