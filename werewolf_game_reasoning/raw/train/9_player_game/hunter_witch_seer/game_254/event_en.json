No. 5 claimed to be the Witch in the first speech, showing great confidence in their identity. No. 5's speech was logical and clear, analyzing the situation from a good person's perspective. Their speech was very convincing, making me strongly believe that No. 5 is indeed the Witch. I trust that No. 6 is the Hunter because werewolves wouldn't be foolish enough to claim to be the Hunter and risk being shot. No. 7's speech was vague, making their identity unclear.
