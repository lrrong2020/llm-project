Player 1 immediately countered by also claiming to be the Seer and declaring Player 2 as a good identity. I believe Player 9's accusation of Player 1 carries significant weight because if Player 9 were a werewolf, the chances of randomly accusing the real Seer among six good players in later positions would be very low! Therefore, I'm inclined to believe that Player 9, whom I saved last night, is the Seer who was targeted, and Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer after being accused. Player 2, after receiving a good identity from Player 1, switched sides to support Player 9, which leads me to believe that Player 2 is likely not on the same team as Player 1 and is probably a good player. Player 5's speech was very brief, yet Player 6 illogically concluded that Player 5 is good, which seems like a werewolf trying to avoid attention. Thus, I believe Player 6 is a werewolf. Tonight, I will use my poison on Player 6. This round, I support Player 9 and vote to eliminate Player 1.",

No.1 then immediately claimed to be a seer after receiving this accusation. I believe No.9's accusation of No.1 carries significant weight, because if No.9 were a werewolf, the probability of correctly identifying the real seer as a bad identity would be very low. Therefore, No.9 is likely the real seer.\n\n- **Player No.1**: After being accused by No.9, they immediately claimed to be a seer and declared No.2 as a good identity. I believe No.1's claim of being a seer and identifying a later-position player as good carries no weight at all.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player No.9 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Assessments of Other Players Based on the Seer's Information:\n- **Player No.1**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against No.9.\n- **Player No.6**: Illogically considers No.5, who gave a vague speech in an earlier position, to be good.

Yesterday, Player 8 claimed to be the hunter in the last position, while Player 5 cast a single vote for Player 8. This suggests that Player 5 might be the real hunter, using their vote to prove their hunter identity. However, today is not the round to eliminate Players 5 and 8. We have a confirmed bad identity, so let's all vote to eliminate Player 4, the framing werewolf! If Player 6 correctly poisoned a werewolf, then the game will end after we eliminate Player 4 today.
