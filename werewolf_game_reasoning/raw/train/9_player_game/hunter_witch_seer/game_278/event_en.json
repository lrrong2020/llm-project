This can increase my credibility as the Seer and make it easier for the players after me to support me. I hope all good players can support me this round, so I can focus on finding the werewolves for everyone. I can't call for votes this round, I can only hope that the werewolf team will send one werewolf to pretend to be a Seer against me.

Their night strategy was to have the werewolf in the earlier position pretend to be the Seer and declare their werewolf teammate in a later position as a good identity. Then, the werewolf in the later position would also pretend to be the Seer, thus elevating the status of the later-positioned werewolf teammate. I must say, the werewolf team's planned tactics are indeed clever, but you made a mistake by declaring me, the Witch, as a bad identity. I've seen through your little trick. If there's another werewolf in a later position pretending to be the Witch, I will use my poison on that werewolf tonight. Today, I will vote for Player 8.

Clearly, Player 8's verification carries the most weight. In my opinion, Player 7 giving a good identity to a player in a later position was an attempt to gain the trust of the good team, but unfortunately, they gave it to the real Seer. In any case, thanks to Player 7, the werewolf, for helping us blind villagers choose sides. Player 7, you're an excellent werewolf!

I believe Number 7, as a werewolf, gave a good identity to a later-speaking good player to gain trust and favor from the good team. Number 9 is a werewolf who pretended to be the Witch after being identified as bad by Seer Number 8. Number 3, who is competing with 9 for the Witch role, is the real Witch. Witch Number 3 gave Number 2 a silver water. If Number 2 was a werewolf who killed himself last night, there would be no benefit for him to pretend to be the Hunter and side with the real Seer during the day, as he would be voted out by the real Hunter. I believe Number 2's speech shows he's a good player seriously analyzing the situation from a good perspective, so I think he's the real Hunter. Since I know my own identity card shows I'm a villager, the last werewolf must be among Numbers 1, 4, and 6. Today, I will follow Seer Number 8 and vote to eliminate werewolf Number 9 who received the bad identity. I request Witch Number 3 to use her poison on werewolf Number 7 tonight.

After listening to Number 7's speech for a round, allowing Number 7 to reveal more of a werewolf's perspective, I believe Number 3's decision was reasonable. Yesterday, Number 2, a werewolf who killed himself, pretended to be the Hunter, but since Number 2 sided with Number 8, the true Seer, I didn't reveal myself. However, now that Number 8, the Seer, has been eliminated at dawn, only the Witch and I remain as special roles. At this point, I must step forward to lead the good team to victory! Today, I urge all good players to join me in voting out Number 2, who pretended to be the Hunter. Witch, please use your poison on Number 7, the werewolf, tonight.",

Now that the seer has been eliminated, there are only two special roles left: the witch and the hunter. If we mistakenly vote out the hunter today, and the hunter shoots a werewolf upon elimination, the last werewolf could kill the witch at night, resulting in the good team's loss. Therefore, we can only vote out the fake seer first, and let the witch poison the fake hunter at night. This is the only way for the good team to win.

So, let's consider this: if Player 3 were the real witch, after Player 9 was voted out, who would Player 3 choose to poison? Certainly not Player 8. It would definitely be Player 7! Because Player 8 switched sides during the sheriff election and voted out Player 9, who was in a witch identity claim conflict with Player 3. But what actually happened? Only Player 8 died last night. This proves that Player 3 is not the witch, but Player 9 was the real witch. Only when the witch has already been eliminated would we see a single death at night.\n\nAs for Player 8, I think they might be a foolish villager who still doesn't believe I'm the real seer. They mistakenly claimed to be the seer and declared Player 9 (the witch) as having a bad identity, which has led to the current chaotic situation. It's precisely because Player 8 made this mistake that the werewolves chose not to pretend to be the seer against me. Their goal was to vote out the real witch.\n\nEveryone, please think carefully. If I were a werewolf and Player 8 were the real seer, why wouldn't my werewolf teammates in later speaking positions also claim to be the seer, given that I've already declared a good identity for the seer in my first speech? Only if Player 9 were the witch would the werewolves choose not to pretend to be the seer! The werewolves' true intention was to vote out Player 9, the witch, then kill Player 8 at night to confirm Player 8's seer identity, and vote me out the next day!\n\nI hope the good team can understand my speech and not be led astray by the werewolves. Today, I'm calling for votes against Player 3. Anyone who doesn't vote for Player 3 today is a werewolf.",

Player 3, the Witch, chose not to use the poison, resulting in only player 8's death. During the daytime speech phase, I decided to continue pretending to be the Seer and declared player 4 as a good identity. In the end, I called for votes against player 3, the real Witch.\n- The situation for the werewolves is now very dangerous, as both the Witch and the Hunter are still alive, and the Witch still has her poison. My werewolf teammate, player 5, chose to pretend to be the Hunter this round. If I'm voted out, it will be very difficult for player 5 to survive, and the werewolves will almost certainly lose. Therefore, I absolutely cannot be voted out today. The only chance for victory is to vote out the real Witch, player 3.\nBased on this, I've decided to vote for player 3.",

When two players claim to be the Seer, one of them must be the real Seer. Before considering Player 8 as a werewolf, we need to consider that Player 7, who claimed Player 8 as a good identity, is a werewolf.
