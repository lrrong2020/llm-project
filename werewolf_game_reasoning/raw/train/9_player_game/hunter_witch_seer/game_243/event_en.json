Moreover, Player 3 claimed to be the witch but didn't make any effort to influence the later players, so I think Player 3 is likely the real witch.

Among the players who haven't spoken yet - players 1, 2, and 9 - one of them will definitely claim to be the Seer against me.

This makes me suspect that Number 6 might be hinting at Number 7 to pretend to be the seer. Number 6 also didn't consider whether their saved player, Number 7, could be a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive the witch. I think Number 6's speech doesn't align with a good person's perspective and lacks the typical thought process of a villager, so Number 6 is likely a werewolf. Number 7 immediately believed Number 6 was the real witch just because Number 6 claimed to have saved them. I think Number 7 is a werewolf with night information. In my opinion, Numbers 6 and 7 seem more like werewolves covering for each other.

I fully trust Player 3's claim as the Witch in this position, so I believe Player 3 is the real Witch, and Player 9 is a werewolf who killed themselves last night.\n\nPlayers 4 and 5 claimed to be villagers, and their statements were fairly objective without much information. I believe they are both players who don't have night actions and haven't gained much information, so I can temporarily trust their villager identities.\n\nI think Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch. The real Witch (Player 3) should use the poison on Player 6 tonight. Player 6 thought that Player 3 giving Player 9 the saved status was to encourage Player 9 to claim to be the Seer, but Player 3's statement was to report the saved player, helping the Seer in a later position and good players analyze the situation. Instead, Player 6 was giving hints to Player 7, suggesting that Player 7 would claim to be the Seer, siding with Player 7 before they even spoke.\n\nPlayer 7's reasoning for verifying players is also problematic. Player 7 stated that if Player 8 is a good identity, they could help analyze the situation, but Player 7 didn't consider what would happen if Player 8 was a werewolf. This indicates that Player 7 has already assumed Player 8 would be a good identity, so I believe Player 8 has a good identity.\n\nTherefore, I think Players 6, 7, and 9 are the three werewolves.

Secondly, Player 9 claimed to be the hunter in an early speaking position, while Player 1, speaking later, declared Player 9 as a bad identity. If Player 9 is the real hunter, they would shoot Player 1 if voted out, which wouldn't benefit Player 1 much. Now, let's look at Player 1's speech. Player 9 has already clearly stated they don't side with Player 7. If Player 9 were the real hunter, Player 1 would have no reason to declare them as a bad identity. Player 1 could easily give a good identity to any villager in a later speaking position, making it easy to vote out Player 7, then kill the witch at night and the hunter the next day for an easy win. Therefore, I believe Player 1's speech doesn't sound like a werewolf's. In conclusion, I think Player 1 is the real seer, which means Player 9 is the bad identity, Player 7 is pretending to be a seer, and Player 8 is likely a good person who's not on the same team as Player 7.

Therefore, No.7 might not be the Seer, and we should respect the good identity's will and judgment, reasonably suspecting that No.7 could be a werewolf.\n- **Player No.1**: No.1 declares No.9, who has already claimed to be the Hunter, as a bad identity. If No.1 were a werewolf and No.9 were the real Hunter, given that No.9 has clearly stated they won't side with No.7 but with the later-speaking Seer, No.1 could have simply declared anyone as a good identity.
