Whoever claims to be the Hunter is a werewolf in my eyes! I think Player 6, who claimed to be the Seer in the first position and gave a good identity to a player who hasn't spoken yet, is very credible as they're not afraid of being challenged when the votes are called. Player 6's speech had no obvious mistakes, their logic and perspective were quite correct, and the good identity they gave me is quite tempting. For now, I'm tentatively siding with Player 6. As for why I'm not blindly supporting Player 6, it's because I'm a thoughtful good player. I won't be led by just anyone who throws a good identity my way. I still need to listen to the speeches of other players who might claim to be the Seer before making a final decision. Player 8 died alone last night, and I can't define their identity. I won't analyze the low probability event of Player 8 being the Seer who was killed for now. In any case, before hearing all players' speeches, I will continue to think carefully!

Clearly, Player 7's speech would significantly lower the credibility of Player 6's Seer claim, so I don't believe Players 6 and 7 are both werewolves.

Then look at Player 7's speech praising Player 6's statement as great - I don't even know what was so good about Player 6's speech. I think Player 1's speech is just supporting their werewolf teammates, Players 6 and 7. Moreover, Player 1 was identified as a bad identity by Seer 9. Player 1, you were identified as a bad identity by the Seer, so naturally, you're speaking up for your werewolf teammates. But isn't your speech just pure nonsense? Looking at your statement again, you said that if anyone claims to be the Hunter later, you'll definitely vote for them. This is clearly a statement that exposes you as a werewolf. Doesn't this imply that you're expecting the real Hunter to challenge your werewolf teammate, Player 7? Your speech is incredibly prescient, but it's precisely this foresight that has harmed your werewolf team. Today, as the Witch, I'm voting for werewolf Player 7. If the werewolves kill me tonight, I'll use my poison on Player 1. The next day, the good team can vote out werewolf Player 6.",

No.7, receiving the good identity, claims to be the Hunter and sides with No.6. No.1, receiving the bad identity, claims to be a Villager.\n- Besides the Seer dispute, there are two players claiming to be the Hunter: No.7, who received a good identity from No.6, claims to be the Hunter and sides with No.6. No.2 claims to be the Hunter and sides with No.9.\n- No.5, being the last to speak, firmly claims to be the Witch and supports No.9. No.5 is a werewolf.\n\n# Further analysis of potential werewolves:\n- If No.2 is the real Hunter, then No.7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. No.6, who gave a good identity to No.7, is also a werewolf. No.1, who received a bad identity from the real Seer No.9, is also a werewolf. This would account for three werewolves: No.7, No.6, and No.1. However, I already know No.5 is a werewolf, so No.2 being the Hunter is impossible - it would mean there are four werewolves. Therefore, No.2 is not the Hunter, but a werewolf.\n- Now we know No.2 and No.5 are werewolves. Since No.6 and No.9 are both claiming to be the Seer, one of them must be a werewolf. This completes the trio of werewolves, meaning No.1 in the outer position must be good. Consequently, No.9, who gave a bad identity to No.1, is the third werewolf.\n- In conclusion, all werewolves have been identified: No.2, No.5, and No.9.\n- Because this round, from other good players' perspective, No.2 and No.7 are both claiming to be the Hunter, they will likely vote between these two. Even though I know all three werewolves, I can't vote for the other werewolves this round as it would split the vote. I can only vote for No.2, the werewolf.\n\n# In summary, I believe No.2 is a werewolf, and I will vote to eliminate No.2 this round.",

However, when two players claim to be the Hunter, we must vote out one of them on the first day. This is because the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, while the Seer cannot self-verify. Therefore, on the first day, we need to prioritize resolving the true and false Hunter issue, allowing the two Seers to report one more day of verification information before making a decision.\n\nCurrently, players 2 and 7 claim to be the Hunter.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Hunter, supports player 9 who is pretending to be a Seer. I saw that my identity card shows I'm a villager, but player 9 gave me a bad identity. This means player 9 is a werewolf, and player 2 who supports player 9 is a fake Hunter.\n\n- **Player 7**: Claims to be the Hunter. Player 9 gave me a bad identity, so player 9 is a werewolf. Player 6, who is competing with player 9 for the Seer role and gave player 7 a good identity, is the real Seer. Therefore, player 7 is the real Hunter.\n\nBased on this, I believe player 7 is the real Hunter. I decide to vote for player 2.",

If player 6 is a Werewolf, then player 9, who is competing with 6 to be the Seer, must be the real Seer. In that case, player 9's bad identity check on player 1 would confirm 1 as a Werewolf. If player 1 were a Werewolf, they should have claimed a special role to confuse the situation, making the good team worry about taking the wrong side and mistakenly voting out a special role, thus hesitating to vote for player 1. However, player 1 didn't claim any special role to save themselves after being identified as a bad identity, so player 1 is most likely a Villager. This means player 9 is probably pretending to be the Seer, and player 2 is likely 9's fellow Werewolf, claiming to be the Hunter to protect player 9 and trying to vote out the real Hunter.\n\n- **Player No. 7**: Player 7 is player 6's good identity. If player 7 were player 6's Werewolf teammate, there would be no need to claim to be the Hunter. They could simply claim to be a Villager and blend in with the crowd. By claiming to be the Hunter now, player 7 is easily making themselves a focal point, so I believe player 7 is the real Hunter.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the real Hunter.
