This suggests that Player 2 might be the Hunter, as such a confident statement aligns with the Hunter's typical attitude. However, it could also be a werewolf using reverse logic, fearing being identified as a bad identity by the real Seer, and intentionally saying they anticipate being identified to create an excuse for attacking the real Seer later. Moreover, if Player 2 were a villager, they wouldn't usually draw attention to themselves. Therefore, I believe Player 2 is either the Hunter or a werewolf. Player 3 claims to be the Witch. I am not the Witch, so if there's a Witch in the later positions, they can poison Player 3 tonight. This is because if Player 3 were good, there's no need to claim the Witch role this round when the Witch doesn't need protection. However, I think Player 3's speech, while giving Player 9 a good identity, also mentioned closely observing Player 9's speech and potentially poisoning them if deemed a werewolf. Based on this, I believe Player 3 is likely the real Witch.",

I think Player 3 is most likely the real witch, as there's no advantage for a werewolf to pretend to be the witch in this situation. Player 2 claimed to be a villager with a rather vague speech, but as the first speaker, it's understandable. If I were in that position, I would probably give a similar vague speech, so I tentatively believe Player 2 is good. Player 4's speech aligns with a good player's perspective and shows good player reasoning, so I think Player 4 is good.

Therefore, Player 3 is likely the real Witch. I actually wanted to analyze Player 2 as a possible inactive werewolf, but since Player 3, the Witch, thinks Player 2 is good, I can't go against the Witch's opinion and label Player 2 as a werewolf. So, for now, I'll define Player 2's identity as a villager. If I were a werewolf, there would be no need for me to falsely accuse Player 9, who is Player 3's saved target, of being a werewolf, as this would only antagonize the Witch. Thus, I can only be the real Seer who indeed verified Player 9 as a werewolf. This is my explanation to the good players in later positions about why I am the Seer, and I hope everyone understands! Player 5, who spoke earlier, believes that both Players 2 and 4 are good. Therefore, Player 5's credibility is lower than that of Players 2 and 4. I think Player 5 might be a werewolf trying to gain favor with Players 2 and 4. I've decided to verify Player 5's identity tonight.

I'm inclined to think Player 2 is a good person because they are a villager protected by the werewolves. Player 6 wanted to use Player 2's vote to help vote for Player 9. He also said that werewolves wouldn't make unnecessary small moves to provoke the good people, which aligns with his psychological motivation to define Player 2 as good. Then he chose to challenge the Seer role from among the players in later positions who hadn't spoken yet, so he gave Player 9 a bad identity. I'm sorry, Player 6, but you didn't succeed in your challenge. I am the real Seer. Today, we should all vote for Player 6. Tonight, I will verify Player 5's identity because Player 6 said he wanted to check Player 5. As a werewolf pretending to be a Seer who can't make too many enemies, targeting Player 5 like this seems like a werewolf trying to establish an identity for their teammate.

Since only player 3 from the earlier positions claimed to be the witch, in case player 6 votes for the hunter, I, as a non-special villager, can better choose sides. From player 2's speech, I can sense a feeling of resignation, making their identity hard to define. They could be either a pretentious werewolf or a villager. Player 3 claims to be the witch, and I believe them, as there's no benefit for a werewolf to falsely claim this role. Player 5 mentioned that player 2 claimed to be a villager, and their speech was rather vague, but understandable given their first speaking position. If player 5 were in that position, they would likely give a similar vague speech. So player 5 tentatively considers player 2 as good, but couldn't a werewolf also give a vague speech in that position? Player 5 shows no depth of thought, and from their speech, it's clear they assume player 2 is good by default. Therefore, I believe player 5 is a werewolf who has revealed their perspective. I will choose sides based on player 9's speech and will definitely cast my vote for the player I believe to be suspicious.",

It's unlikely that player 9 is a good player mistakenly claiming a role, so player 9 must be a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. Excluding the possibility of a werewolf identifying another werewolf as bad, player 6's identification of player 9 as bad aligns with the behavior of a true Seer. From my perspective, player 6 is the real Seer, and player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Therefore, I choose to support player 6 as the Seer this round and vote to eliminate player 9.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for player 9, who was identified as bad by player 6.",

I have already claimed the Witch role and announced my silver water. Player 9 has also claimed to be the Hunter this round.\n- Players 6 and 7 are both claiming to be the Seer: Player 6 gave Player 9 a bad identity, while Player 7 gave Player 8 a good identity.\n- Player 6 assumes Player 2 is a werewolf, but only because Player 3 (who claims to be the Witch) thinks Player 2 is leaning towards being good. Also, Player 9 has claimed to be the Hunter, and no one has contested this claim. Therefore, Player 6 seems to be a werewolf card that wants to accuse Player 2 but doesn't dare to, and instead gives a bad identity to the real Hunter.\n- Player 7, despite Player 6 giving Player 9 a bad identity, gave Player 8 a good identity. Their verification process seems more reasonable. Moreover, if Player 7 were a werewolf, giving a bad identity to an outer position player would make it easier to push out a good player, putting werewolves at an advantage. Therefore, Player 7's action of giving Player 8 a good identity seems more like a real Seer's behavior.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe Player 7 is the Seer and Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.
