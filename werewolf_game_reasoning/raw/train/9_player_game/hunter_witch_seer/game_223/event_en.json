Currently, the identities of the eliminated No. 5 and No. 9 are unknown, so I choose to wait for the Seer claims from the later positions before deciding whom to support!

If No. 8 is the real Witch, they will likely be targeted by the werewolves at night, as the Witch can't save themselves on the second night. The werewolves surely won't kill someone in a later position and end up with a peaceful night. Therefore, for this round, I'll tentatively treat No. 8 as the Witch. However, if No. 8 is still alive tomorrow, they might actually be a werewolf. No. 1 didn't comment at all on No. 8's claim to be the Witch in an earlier position, which I don't think is typical good player behavior. With three players already dead and the Seer possibly not even in the game, every good player's speech should be very cautious. If we vote incorrectly, the good team will be in an irredeemable situation. I believe No. 1's perspective completely ignores No. 8, which doesn't seem like the thought process of a good player. If we don't have two players claiming to be the Seer or if the Seer hasn't identified a bad identity this round, I will vote to eliminate No. 1.",

Player 2's speech pointed out that Player 1 didn't pay attention to Player 8, which shows that Player 2 is a thoughtful villager. Player 2 made a good point; we only need to see if Player 8 dies tomorrow to determine if they're the Witch. If Player 8 doesn't die, it could only mean they're a werewolf. Moreover, if Player 8 survives tomorrow, it also proves that Player 1 is a werewolf, because Player 1's speech didn't consider Player 8 as the Witch at all. They must be werewolf teammates. We'll see all the answers tomorrow! Today, as the Seer, I'm voting for Player 1. If any werewolves try to protect Player 1, I hope the villagers will firmly stand with your true Seer, Player 4, and vote for Player 1 together! Here's another bold logic: if all the dead players are villagers, the werewolves already have the advantage to form a binding vote, meaning Player 1 wouldn't need to pretend. If the werewolves don't form a binding vote today, it means there must be a werewolf among the dead players. Also, if Players 6 and 7 don't claim to be the Seer, and considering Player 1's werewolf speech, we can deduce that Player 8 might be Player 1's teammate, the last werewolf. In conclusion, today we should vote for Player 1, the werewolf. Don't try to change my vote!",

Player 1's statements are mostly filler, lacking substance, and they repeatedly mention the Witch issue. Player 8, in an earlier position, claimed to be the Witch, but Player 1 seemed to ignore this fact completely. This suggests that Player 1's perspective is incorrect and doesn't align with a villager's viewpoint. As for whether Player 8 is actually the Witch, if they are eliminated tomorrow, it would confirm they were the real Witch, unable to save themselves even with a potion. However, if a player in a later position is eliminated tomorrow, Player 8 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the Witch. This round, I will follow Player 4's lead as the Seer and vote to eliminate Player 1 as a werewolf.",
