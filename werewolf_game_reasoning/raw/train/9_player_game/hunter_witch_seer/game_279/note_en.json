I am a villager.\n- **Player 1**: Claims seer, reports Player 2 as bad identity, believes Player 9 is a villager, wants to check Player 8, votes for Player 2. I analyze that Player 1 is likely the seer because they gave Player 2 a bad identity, and Player 2 immediately pretended to be a seer. Therefore, Player 1's verification seems more credible than Player 2's, so Player 1 is probably the seer.\n- **Player 2**: Claims seer, reports Player 3 as bad identity, believes Players 7 and 8 are good, wants to check Player 6, eliminate Player 3, asks the witch to poison Player 1. I analyze that Player 2 is a werewolf because Player 1 gave them a bad identity, and Player 2 immediately pretended to be a seer and gave Player 3 a bad identity. I believe Player 2 is a werewolf who pretended to be a seer, giving Player 3 a bad identity to pressure Player 3 to reveal their role.\n- **Player 3**: Claims hunter, believes Player 9 is good, wants to vote for Player 2. I analyze that Player 3 is the hunter because I trust Player 1 as the seer, and Player 2 gave Player 3 a bad identity. I think Player 2 was trying to pressure Player 3 to reveal their role, so Player 3 is likely the hunter.\n- **Player 4**: Claims hunter, if eliminated will take Player 1 with them, asks the witch to poison Player 1. I analyze that Player 4 is a werewolf because Player 2 gave Player 3 a bad identity, Player 3 and Player 4 both claim to be the hunter, but Player 4 says if eliminated they'll take Player 1 instead of Player 3 who also claims to be the hunter. Therefore, I believe Player 4 doesn't have the hunter's perspective.\n- **Player 5**: Claims witch, reports Player 3 as good identity, believes Player 3 is the hunter, wants to side with Player 1, wants to vote for Player 2. I analyze that Player 5 is either a werewolf or the witch because Player 8 and Player 5 both claim to be the witch. I can't distinguish which one is the real witch at the moment.\n- **Player 6**: Claims villager, believes Player 1 is the seer, thinks Player 3 is the hunter, wants to vote for Player 2. I analyze that Player 6 is a villager because among Players 1 and 2 who both claim to be the seer, one is a werewolf; among Players 3 and 4 who both claim to be the hunter, one is a werewolf; among Players 5 and 8 who both claim to be the witch, one is a werewolf. So Player 6 is likely a villager.\n- **Player 7**: Claims villager, wants to vote for Player 4. I analyze that Player 7 is a villager for the same reasons as Player 6.\n- **Player 8**: Claims witch, believes Players 1, 3, and 5 are werewolves, wants to vote for Player 3, poison Player 5. I analyze that Player 8 is either the witch or a werewolf because Player 5 and Player 8 both claim to be the witch. I can't distinguish which one is the real witch at the moment.\n\nIdentity judgments:\n**Player 1**: Seer\n**Player 2**: Werewolf\n**Player 3**: Hunter\n**Player 4**: Werewolf\n**Player 5**: Witch or Werewolf\n**Player 6**: Villager\n**Player 7**: Villager\n**Player 8**: Witch or Werewolf\n**Player 9**: Villager\n\nMy vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 4.",
