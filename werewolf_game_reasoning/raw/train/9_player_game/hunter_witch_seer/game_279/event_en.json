So, Number 2, you're definitely going to be eliminated today! Number 9's early speech was rather vague, without providing useful information, but Number 9 didn't show any werewolf behavior, so I tentatively accept Number 9's villager identity. Number 1, the Seer, gave Number 2 a bad identity, and Number 2 immediately pretended to be a seer and gave me, Number 3, a bad identity. In terms of credibility, Number 1's is much stronger than Number 2's. Number 1, the Seer, said they would verify Number 7 or 8 tonight, showing a defensive move towards the later speakers. Their speech was full and completely demonstrated a Seer's thought process. I believe Number 1 is the true Seer in my heart. In contrast, Number 2's speech merely accepted Numbers 7 and 8 as good people just because Number 1 mentioned verifying them, which clearly shows Number 2 is a werewolf with inside information. Number 2 deliberately expressed trust in Numbers 7 and 8 being good people, precisely to gain the good people's favor, deceive their trust, and incite them to side with him, attempting to vote me, Number 3, out. However, none of this matters. I, Number 3, am the Hunter. If I'm unfortunately eliminated today, I will shoot Number 2, the werewolf who gave me a bad identity. I hope the good people can accept my Hunter identity and join me in voting out Number 2, the werewolf, today.

I originally had a healing potion and a poison potion, but last night, Player 5, the little werewolf, used the despicable tactic of self-inflicted wounds to trick me into using my healing potion. I won't let Player 5 off the hook tonight; I'll use my poison on them when night falls. As the Witch in the last speaking position, let me analyze the current situation. Player 1 claimed to be the Seer and declared Player 2 as a bad identity. Player 2 immediately claimed to be the Seer as well and declared Player 3 as a bad identity. In terms of credibility, Player 1 is definitely more convincing than Player 2. Initially, I wanted to side with Player 1, but after hearing Player 4's speech, I completely changed my mind. I believe Player 4's speech was clear, logical, and provided a thorough analysis of the situation. Player 4 seemed very confident about their identity. They suggested that if the good team couldn't determine who the real Seer was, we shouldn't blindly vote for Player 2, but could vote for them instead, as they have the ability to shoot and reveal their true identity. Player 4's selfless spirit deeply moved me. I believe having such a self-sacrificing Hunter on the good team is a great fortune, so I trust that Player 4 is the Hunter. In conclusion, since Player 3 is claiming the same role as Player 4, who I believe is the Hunter, Player 3 must be a werewolf. This means Player 2, who declared Player 3 as a bad identity, must be the real Seer. The werewolves are Players 1, 3, and 5. Player 1 is the werewolf pretending to be the Seer, Player 3 is the werewolf claiming to be the Hunter against Player 4, and Player 5 is the werewolf claiming to be the Witch against me. This round, we should all vote to eliminate Player 3, and I will use my poison on Player 5 during the night.",

Based on this, let's analyze the situation.\n\n- Player 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter against me.\n- Players 5 and 8 both claim to be the Witch, so one of them is a werewolf and the other is the real Witch.\n- Players 1 and 2 both claim to be the Seer, so one of them is a werewolf and the other is the real Seer.\n\nDetermining the real Seer:\n- I know Player 3 is a werewolf. Player 2 declared Player 3 as a bad identity. In my view, Player 2 and Player 3 can't both be werewolves, because werewolves don't identify each other as bad. Player 1 declared Player 2 as a bad identity. Assuming Player 1 is the real Seer and Player 2 is a werewolf, Player 2 would never declare their werewolf teammate (Player 3) as bad. If Player 2 did so, we would vote between Players 2 and 3 this round, resulting in a werewolf being eliminated either way, which would be a loss for the werewolf team. Therefore, I conclude that Players 2 and 3 are not on the same team. Since Player 3 is a werewolf, Player 2 must be good.\n- Thus, I believe Player 2 is the real Seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 3, who was identified as a werewolf by Player 2, the Seer.",
