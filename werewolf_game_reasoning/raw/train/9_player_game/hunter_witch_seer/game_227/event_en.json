I don't believe a good player would claim to be the Hunter in an earlier position. Anyone who dares to claim my role must be a werewolf trying to confuse the good team. So, No. 2 must be a werewolf. Let me explain again: if I were a werewolf, I wouldn't come out and sacrifice myself, because No. 2 has already claimed the role. I could secretly kill them at night, and they wouldn't know who to shoot, which would be more beneficial for the werewolf team. But now that No. 2, a werewolf, has pretended to be the Hunter, I risk being voted out if I don't speak up. So I must stand up and give all the good players the correct perspective. As for whether No. 1 is the real Witch, if tomorrow isn't a peaceful night, or if No. 1 isn't eliminated, then No. 1 must be a werewolf. For now, I tentatively believe No. 1 is the Witch. No. 3 claims to be the Seer, and I temporarily believe No. 3 is the real Seer. Good players, let's work together to vote out No. 2, the werewolf!",

Moreover, player 2's speech was concise and to the point, without unnecessary rhetoric, fitting the image of a cold-blooded hunter with a gun in hand. In contrast, player 6 gave a long-winded speech, which I think is an attempt to play mind games with the good team, aiming for an extreme \"one-for-one\" exchange.

Last night, players 4 and 5 both died, one of whom might have been a Witch forced to use her poison to prove her identity after being attacked. However, player 1 claimed to be the Witch in the first position, so they could also be the real Witch. We'll see if player 1 is eliminated tonight; if player 1 survives or if it's not a peaceful night, then player 1 must be a werewolf! Between players 2 and 6, I'm more inclined to believe that player 2 is the Hunter. I think werewolves have no reason to claim the Hunter role before the true and fake Seers reveal themselves, as it would put them in the spotlight without any benefit. Therefore, player 2 seems more likely to be the Hunter than player 6. Given that only player 3 has claimed to be the Seer so far, I'll temporarily trust player 3's Seer identity. I'm voting for player 6, who I believe is pretending to be the Hunter!",
