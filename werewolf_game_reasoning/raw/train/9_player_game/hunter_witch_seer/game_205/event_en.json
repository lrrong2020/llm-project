Players 6 and 7 have claimed to be villagers in front of me, so I'm temporarily marking them as good. If either of them were a werewolf, they would have certainly claimed to be the Seer, but since there was no such claim, I consider both Players 6 and 7 to be good.\n\nI'm certain Player 1 will immediately pretend to be the Seer. If they don't, they can only claim another special role, which would prompt the real special character to expose Player 1. If they do claim to be the Seer and declare other players as good, it could be to protect their fellow werewolves or to gain favor with the good players in later positions. Also, remember that the werewolves among you can identify the real Seer, but the good players have no such insight. Therefore, the werewolves will likely support Player 1 and try to vote me, Player 8, out. If I'm voted out today, I urge the Witch to observe the voting pattern and use the poison on the werewolf who led the charge against me tonight!\n\nToday, I ask you all to join me in voting out Player 1, the werewolf!",

In contrast, No. 7's speech criticized No. 6 for being brief and glossing over the night's information, which is suspicious of a passive werewolf. My issue with No. 8 is their seer verification process - randomly checking? How does that benefit the good team? You're not fighting alone; you're supposed to be a seer leading the good team to find and eliminate werewolves. So I believe No. 8 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer, giving a formulaic speech. I'm directly siding with the later-speaking seer. If there's a bad identity, we'll vote for that; if not, we'll vote to eliminate No. 8.",

No. 1's mistakes are obvious; I suspect they might be nervous and incoherent after being identified as a werewolf. They first said No. 6 and No. 7 are good, then claimed not to know their identities. How could a real Seer make such contradictory statements? If No. 1 were truly the Seer, why wouldn't they mention being accurately targeted? This perspective doesn't align with a Seer's role. No. 9 uses the weak logic of \"thought process\" to forcefully accuse Seer No. 8 of being a werewolf. I believe No. 9 is another werewolf supporting No. 1. I've now identified two werewolves: No. 1 and No. 9! As for the identities of No. 6 and No. 7 in the earlier positions, I can't define them yet. Today, I, the Hunter, will lead the vote. Let's unanimously vote out No. 1, the fake Seer. If any foolish werewolf in the later positions dares to claim to be the Hunter, we'll have identified all three werewolves. In that case, we'll immediately vote out that fake Hunter werewolf today, and they certainly won't be able to use the Hunter's gun!",

I believe No. 6 is a good player. As for No. 7's identity, I can't define it at the moment because their speech was too vague. They could be either a villager or a werewolf trying to stay under the radar. No. 8, by assuming No. 6 and No. 7 are good players solely based on their lack of action, I believe is a werewolf with inside information. They said a lot of irrelevant things and desperately tried to pressure No. 1's identity. Therefore, I think No. 1 is the real Seer.

The reason Player 8 feels like the seer to me is because they were certain in their speech that Player 1 would immediately pretend to be the seer, which Player 1 actually did. If Player 8 were pretending to be the seer, even if two of the remaining werewolves were among the later speakers (Players 9, 2, 3, 4, and 5), Player 8 couldn't be completely sure they had identified the real seer. Therefore, I think Player 8 might be the real seer. The reason Player 1 doesn't feel like the seer to me is that, from their perspective, Player 2 is their bad identity, Player 8 is a werewolf competing for the seer role, and Players 6, 7, and 9 are all good. This means the last werewolf should be among Players 3, 4, and 5, but Player 1 doesn't mention them or discuss who they plan to check tonight. So, I believe Player 1 might be pretending to be the seer. Therefore, I will side with Player 8 as the seer and vote for Player 1. However, since Player 4 is also pretending to be the hunter, I've now identified all the werewolves: Players 1, 3, and 4.

Player 8's statement seems more convincing, but we need to analyze their speeches and logic to determine who the real seer is. Player 8 stated, \"Players 6 and 7 acted as villagers in front of me, so I'll temporarily mark them as good identities. If either of them were a werewolf, they would have certainly claimed to be the seer, but they didn't pretend to be one, so I consider players 6 and 7 to be good identities.\" I believe that judging players 6 and 7 as good based solely on their inaction doesn't align with the caution a seer should exhibit. Therefore, I think player 8's statement reflects a werewolf's perspective. Consequently, I believe player 1 is the real seer, and player 8 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer.

Moreover, player 8's speech fails to gain the trust of the good team and lacks a Seer's perspective. Therefore, I think player 8 is a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 1**: Declares player 2 as a bad identity. Their speech is concise while also pointing out player 8's mistake: player 8 concluded that players 6 and 7 are both good based on their brief speeches, which is suspicious of revealing their perspective. If player 8 were the real Seer, they would maintain a skeptical attitude towards those with short speeches, rather than directly accepting players 6 and 7 as good.
