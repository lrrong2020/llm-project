This would not only invite attacks from the real Seer but also from the real Hunter. Number 8 would put himself in a vulnerable position and potentially sacrifice a werewolf. So I believe Number 8 is the real Hunter. Number 7 claimed to be the Seer, but I haven't heard from other players yet, so I won't take sides for now.

Therefore, I believe Player 7's speech doesn't support a seer's identity. Player 4 claims to be the seer, and I definitely side with Player 4. Player 3, who is a werewolf, says if Player 4 claims to be the seer, he'll believe 4 is the seer, so I hope Player 3 will vote for himself in the voting phase! Player 8 is the only hunter in the game, and I have no doubt about 8's hunter identity. If Player 9 were a werewolf, claiming to be the witch and only reporting herself as saved by the potion, without verifying her werewolf teammates' identities, would bring no benefit to the werewolf team, so I believe Player 9 is the witch. Currently, I think the werewolf suspects are Players 7 and 3. This round, I will side with Player 4 as the seer and vote to eliminate Player 3 as a werewolf.",

In my opinion, player 7 doesn't have the ability to verify identities, and their reasoning for checking players resembles a werewolf trying to fake verification during the day. I suspect players 3, 6, and 7 to be werewolves. Player 6 only analyzes one-sided logic and strongly supports player 7 from the last speaking position, showing no villager-like thinking. Therefore, I believe player 6 is a werewolf. I hope the villagers present can reconsider their positions and not help player 7, a werewolf, persecute innocent players. This round, I will vote for player 7 to be eliminated.",
