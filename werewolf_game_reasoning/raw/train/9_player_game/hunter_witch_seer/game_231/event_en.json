Last night was peaceful, and no one challenged No. 9 as the Witch, so No. 9 is the real Witch. I thank No. 9 for saving my good identity, No. 5, last night. No. 3 claims to be the Hunter, and currently, no one is challenging that claim, so I tentatively believe No. 3 is the real Hunter. Players 5, 6, 7, 1, and 2 all claim to be villagers.

I think No. 2 might be a werewolf because their speech simply sided with No. 8 due to No. 8's strong presence, which doesn't align with good player logic.

Player 5 is my silver water, and I have already claimed the Witch role, announced the silver water, and stated that I will use the poison tonight.\n- Players 8 and 4 are both claiming to be the Seer: Player 8 declares Player 9 as good identity, Player 4 declares Player 5 as good identity.\n\n# Seer identity judgment:\n- **Player 8**: By declaring me as good identity, they have already gained my favor. Moreover, when Player 8 spoke, there were only five players left to speak after them. If Player 8 were a werewolf, given that the real Seer hadn't claimed yet, the Seer would definitely be among the later speakers. Player 8 chose to declare Player 9 (me) as good identity, which had a certain probability of hitting the real Seer, potentially exposing the werewolf team. Therefore, Player 8's verification carries significant weight. Additionally, Player 8's speech was standard without obvious flaws, and their comments on the players who spoke before were quite reasonable. I believe Player 8 is more likely to be the real Seer.\n\n- **Player 4**: They declared Player 5 as good identity. Since Player 4 spoke last, their credibility is inherently lower than Player 8's. Moreover, Player 5 was the target on the first night and is also my silver water. I'm quite sensitive about the identity of my silver water. I also think Player 5's speech wasn't good: Player 5 was the first to speak, telling the Witch not to claim their role and report the silver water. This is not behavior typical of a good player, because only the Witch and werewolves know the identity of the silver water. The Witch should claim their role and report the silver water to allow the good team to make judgments. Therefore, Player 5's request for the Witch not to claim and report doesn't seem like good player behavior. Thus, I believe Player 5's identity is questionable, and Player 4 is likely pretending to be a seer.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe Player 4 is pretending to be a seer, and I will vote for Player 4 this round.",

I believe player 8's declaration of player 9 as a good identity carries significant weight, so player 8 is likely the true seer.\n\n- **Player 4**: As a back-position seer, they declared player 5 as a good identity. In their speech, player 4 mentioned: \"Players 5, 6, 7, 1, and 2 in front all claimed to be villagers, I reasonably suspect two of them to be werewolves.\" This statement contains a logical contradiction because player 5 is player 4's good identity, so player 4 has no reason to suspect player 5 of being a werewolf.
