This round, please join me in voting for Player 9. Tonight, based on the speeches and voting patterns, I will check the identity of one player among Players 1 to 6 in the later speaking positions.

If not, then No. 8 is the unopposed Seer, and we should vote out No. 9, who is pretending to be the Hunter. I think if No. 9 were a werewolf, claiming to be the Hunter would make them an easy target for elimination. It would be better to pretend to be the Seer, at least to avoid being shot by the real Hunter. However, as good players, we can't predict what werewolves will do because they have their own logic and behavior. All predictions lack solid logical support and can be considered pseudo-logic.

If I found a good identity, it would help me gather votes; if I found a bad identity, I could immediately eliminate them. Player 7 was the first to claim to be the Witch. I believe there's a high probability that 7 is indeed the real Witch. In a situation where no one has claimed to be the Seer, there's no benefit for a werewolf to pretend to be the Witch, as they would likely be poisoned by the real Witch at night, essentially sacrificing themselves. However, I don't agree with 7's decision not to reveal who they saved last night. The werewolves know who they attacked, but the good players don't. If 7 had revealed this information, it would have given us good players more insight, and we could have analyzed that player's speech today to judge their identity. Since 7 didn't reveal this, I suggest that you, player 7, pay close attention to the saved player's speech and analyze their identity yourself.\n\nPlayer 8 is pretending to be the Seer and has accused player 9 of being a werewolf. However, we currently have players 2 and 9 both claiming to be the Hunter, and I can't determine which one is telling the truth. Following normal logic, if 8 is a fake Seer accusing 9, then 9 should be the real Hunter, and 2 would be 8's werewolf teammate, with their other teammate being player 4 who hasn't spoken yet. But there's another possibility: 8 could be a fake Seer accusing their werewolf teammate 9, who is pretending to be the Hunter, in an attempt to identify the real Hunter's position.\n\nMy suggestion is to vote out player 4 today, as there's an age-old saying in Werewolf: \"If there's a bad identity, vote for the bad identity; not voting for the bad identity is foolish.\" Tonight, I will check player 9's identity. If 9 is good, then the werewolves are likely 2, 4, and 8. If 9 is a werewolf, then the werewolves are likely 4, 8, and 9. Today, I urge all good players to follow my lead and vote to eliminate player 4!",

Your speech consisted of six sentences, each of which I've heard identical versions at least seven or eight times before. Have pretend seers become so careless now? They're really not taking us good people seriously!\n\nNumber 2's perspective doesn't seem like that of a normal good person, because regardless of whether Number 8, as a werewolf in an early position, gives a bad identity to a good person or a good identity to a werewolf, the benefit would certainly be higher than giving a bad identity to a werewolf. If Number 8 gives a bad identity to their werewolf teammate, on the first day, a werewolf would be eliminated regardless, and the werewolf team might not necessarily gain the trust of the witch and villagers.\n\nAssuming Number 9 is a werewolf, the probability of Number 8 being a werewolf is much lower than being a seer. Therefore, it's bewildering that Number 2 suggests Number 8 is likely a werewolf!\n\nI believe we must vote between Numbers 2 and 9 this round, because now all three special roles have been claimed, and the good people can't fully accept Number 3 or 8. Therefore, the witch must poison a werewolf tonight, otherwise, the good people might lose. Today, let's vote between the real and fake hunters. This will not only help clarify allegiances but also assist the witch in using her poison. Even if the hunter is unfortunately voted out, they can still shoot to help the good people regain control of the situation!\n\nNumber 2 is most likely a werewolf pretending to be a hunter.

Specifically, No. 3 and No. 8 are both claiming to be the Seer, No. 6 and No. 7 are both claiming to be the Witch, and No. 2 and No. 9 are both claiming to be the Hunter. I believe among them, there are three good roles and three werewolves. No. 3 claimed to have checked No. 4 as a bad identity, while No. 8 claimed to have checked No. 9 as a bad identity.\n- Since there are only three werewolves, the outer positions No. 1 and No. 4 must be good players. Because No. 3 claimed No. 4 as a bad identity, No. 3 must be a werewolf, which means No. 8 is the real Seer. Since No. 8 is the Seer, their verification information is true, so No. 9 is a werewolf.\n- Therefore, the werewolves are No. 3, No. 9, and either No. 6 or No. 7.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe No. 8 is the real Seer. No. 8 is calling for votes against No. 9, so I will follow the Seer and vote for No. 9 to be eliminated this round.",

With these three werewolf positions filled, the outer positions 1, 4, and 5 must be good people. Therefore, player 3 giving player 4 (a good person) a bad identity is certainly false, which means 3 is pretending to be a seer, while 8 is the real seer. Player 8 declared 9 as bad identity, so 9 is a werewolf. Thus, the three werewolves are players 3, 7, and 9.

They stated that if there's another player in a later position also claiming to be the Hunter, others can vote for player 9, and they will use their ability to take player 8 with them. If there's no other Hunter claim in later positions, they suggest voting for player 8.\n\n- Player 2: After seeing player 9 claim to be the Hunter, they also claimed to be the Hunter and suggested voting for player 9.\n\nVoting result analysis:\n- Player 8, claiming to be the Seer, gave a bad identity result to player 9.\n- If we vote for player 9 and they use their Hunter ability to shoot player 8, it proves that player 8 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, and player 9 is the real Hunter.\n- If we vote for player 9 and they fail to use their ability, it proves that player 9 is a werewolf, player 2 is the Hunter, and if we rule out the possibility of players 8 and 9 both being werewolves, then player 8 is likely the real Seer who gave a bad identity result to player 9 (werewolf).\n- If we vote for player 2 and they use their Hunter ability to shoot player 9, it proves that player 2 is the Hunter, player 9 is a werewolf, and if we rule out the possibility of players 8 and 9 both being werewolves, then player 8 is likely the real Seer who gave a bad identity result to player 9 (werewolf).\n- If we vote for player 2 and they fail to use their ability, it proves that player 2 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, player 9 is the real Hunter, and player 8 must be a werewolf who gave a bad identity result to player 9 (the real Hunter).\n- Since voting for either player 2 or 9 is equally beneficial for judging the situation, and player 9 only claimed to be the Hunter after receiving a bad identity result from player 8, I decide to prioritize voting for player 9. If player 9 shoots player 8, we can also rule out the possibility of players 8 and 9 both being werewolves with one giving a bad identity result to the other.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 9.",

Between players 9 and 2, who both claimed to be the Hunter, one is a werewolf. Among players 8 and 3, who both claimed to be the Seer, one is a werewolf. Therefore, the remaining players 1, 4, and 5 can only be villagers. Based on the assumption that 4 is a villager, Number 3, who gave a bad identity to 4, would be a werewolf, making 8 the real seer and 9 the werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. However, with the crisp sound of a gunshot, my logic collapsed. Now that 9 is confirmed as the Hunter by game rules, 2 must be the werewolf who pretended to be the Hunter. Number 8, who gave a bad identity to 9, is the werewolf pretending to be the seer, which means 3 is the real seer. Number 4, being identified as a bad identity by 3, can only be a werewolf, and the remaining werewolf is Number 2.",

That's why I wanted to go along with 8's plan, so I deliberately pretended to be the hunter to vote for player 9, whom I suspected was a werewolf. I never expected 9 to be the real hunter. I was wrong, I was truly wrong! Last night, I verified that 7 is a werewolf. 7 claimed to be the witch in the first position, precisely to draw out the real witch, then kill her at night - an extremely sinister plan! The three werewolves on the field are: 3 pretending to be a seer, 7 pretending to be the witch, and 8 also pretending to be a seer. I am the real seer, 6 is the real witch, and 9 is the real hunter. To all the good people here, although I'm the only special role left, we shouldn't give up. Good people will never surrender! Today, please join me in lynching werewolf 7.

Then I realized that all three werewolves - No. 2, 4, and 8 - have already been identified, so it doesn't matter who the werewolves kill now. The villagers are in a winning position. Yesterday, I expressed my dissatisfaction with No. 8 and pointed out the logical contradictions in No. 2's statements, ultimately voting for No. 2. However, No. 6 claimed to be the Witch in the last position. Analyzing the potential werewolf positions, one werewolf is either No. 7 or 6 who claimed to be the Witch, another is either No. 9 or 2 who claimed to be the Hunter, and the third is either No. 3 or 8 who claimed to be the Seer. In the end, I could only vote for No. 9. Since No. 9 was eliminated and fired a shot, No. 7 must be a villager. I don't understand why No. 7 claimed to be the Witch on the first day; it wasn't even the right time to protect the real Witch. Fortunately, we have No. 2 and 4, two werewolves, in line to be poisoned, otherwise No. 7 would have been poisoned out. If No. 7 had been poisoned out, wouldn't that have been unfair? No. 2 claimed to be the Seer this round, but his speech essentially made the same mistake as in the first round - assuming that No. 8 and 9 were both werewolves. In the first round, No. 2 claimed to be the Hunter, so No. 8 should have been the Seer from his perspective. This round, No. 2 claimed to be the Seer, so from his first-day perspective, No. 9 should have been the real Hunter. How could he suspect both No. 8 and 9 to be werewolves? Lastly, I'd like to address the werewolf No. 2. Seeing your speech this round, I'm somewhat moved. We've seen your efforts, and you've managed to earn my respect despite the circumstances. Today, I vote to eliminate the werewolf No. 2.",
