To all the good players: Player 1 won't be able to claim any role this round! If Player 1 dares to claim to be the Witch, the real Witch should use the poison on Player 1 tonight. If Player 1 dares to pretend to be a Seer right away, it won't have any credibility, and we can directly vote Player 1 out today. If Player 1 dares to claim to be the Hunter, we should all vote them out immediately. The real Hunter doesn't even need to reveal themselves; we can just vote Player 1 out today to prevent the werewolves from identifying the Hunter's position. If Player 1 claims to be a villager, let their teammates try to save them, which will expose two werewolves. We should vote Player 1 out today, and tonight the Witch can poison the werewolf pretending to be the Seer.

I believe player 8's assessment of player 7's identity aligns with a good player's perspective, because my good identity player 7 was indeed rather passive in their first speech, making it difficult for good players without information to determine player 7's identity. For now, I consider player 8 to be good. Player 1's self-defense speech sounds very sincere, and given that player 9, who is pretending to be a Seer, declared player 1 as a bad identity, player 1 is my reverse good identity. I initially believe player 1 is good. Player 2 claims to be the Witch, and since no one else is contesting this role, I trust player 2's Witch identity. However, I need to address player 2: you've chosen the wrong side! Player 3 didn't wait to hear from other players claiming to be the Seer in later positions, and immediately sided with player 9 after hearing only their speech. Without a doubt, player 3 is player 9's teammate, supporting the fake Seer. Today, please join me in voting out player 9 who is pretending to be the Seer. Tonight, the Witch should use the poison to eliminate player 3. I will check for the last werewolf based on the voting results.",

In the scenario where both No.1 and No.4 are werewolves, No.1 wouldn't need to claim villager instead of Seer, as it would expose No.4 as a fake Seer. In such a case, No.1 could easily claim to be the Seer. Even if No.1 gets voted out, as long as the werewolves kill No.9 at night, No.4's identity wouldn't be exposed to the good team. Moreover, No.1 could claim to be the Witch to draw out No.2 Witch, or claim to be the Hunter to draw out No.5 Hunter. But claiming to be a villager brings no benefit to the werewolf team, so No.1 must be a villager. I find No.7's speech inconclusive; they could be either a villager or a werewolf. No.8's judgment on No.7 is unclear, and I can't determine No.8's identity either; they could be a villager or a werewolf. No.9 is likely pretending to be the Seer. No.1 received a bad identity check, so they're likely good. No.2 claiming to be the Witch early on is probably the real Witch. No.3 immediately supporting No.9 as the Seer without considering later speakers is likely a werewolf supporting the fake Seer. Therefore, No.4 is the real Seer. And I, No.5, am the Hunter. Since No.7 and No.8 could be either villagers or werewolves, and No.9 is a werewolf, No.1 is good, No.2 is the Witch, No.3 is a werewolf, No.4 is the Seer, No.5 is the Hunter, and given that this game has 3 special roles, 3 werewolves, and 3 villagers, No.6 must be either a werewolf or a villager.

The speech doesn't particularly sound like a Seer, but there are no obvious mistakes. As No. 9 spoke in an earlier position, we can be more tolerant.\n- **Player No. 4**: Claimed to be the Seer in a later position, declaring No. 7 as good identity. Their verification thought process is slightly inconsistent and not very reasonable. No. 8 attacked their good identity No. 7, yet No. 4 thinks No. 8 seems like a good person, which I find hard to accept. Moreover, No. 4 directly suggested the Witch to poison No. 3 who sided with No. 9. I find this somewhat inappropriate, as No. 3 might be a good person who hasn't identified the real Seer. No. 8's speech attacked No. 4's good identity, and I think No. 3's speech is slightly less suspicious than No. 8's, but not to the extent of protecting No. 8 while letting No. 3 be poisoned. Therefore, I believe No. 4 might have revealed their night role, possibly pretending to be a seer.\n- In conclusion, I believe No. 9 is likely the Seer, No. 4 is pretending to be a seer, and No. 1 is the werewolf identified by No. 9.\n\n# Therefore, I believe voting for Player No. 1 is the safest choice this round.",
