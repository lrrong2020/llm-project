If Number 8 was a bad identity, we could directly vote them out. Last night was peaceful, indicating that the Witch used her healing potion. Number 6 claims to be the Witch, and I have no reason to doubt their identity. If Number 6 were a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, they would be poisoned by the real Witch at night. So, for now, I believe Number 6 is the real Witch. Number 6, claiming to be the Witch, says Number 9 is protected by her potion. Since I haven't heard Number 9's speech yet, I can't define their identity at the moment. Number 4, in the first position, directly claimed to be the Hunter. I believe Number 4's purpose in claiming to be the Hunter is to prevent werewolves in later positions from falsely claiming the Hunter role to deceive the good team. I find Number 4's speech quite credible, so I tentatively believe Number 4 is the Hunter. If any player in a later position also claims to be the Hunter, I will compare the speeches of both potential Hunters to analyze who is the real one. Number 5's speech was vague, so their identity is undefined for now. Tonight, I will verify the identity of Number 2. I ask the good team to join me today in voting out the werewolf who might pretend to be a Seer in the later positions. If no werewolf pretends to be a Seer, I will vote for the player whose speech sounds most like a werewolf.",

From my perspective, Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and Player 9 might be their werewolf teammate. Tonight, I will use my poison on Player 6, the werewolf who falsely claimed to be the Witch. Player 7 declared me as a good identity. Player 7's willingness to declare a later-speaking player as good shows confidence, as they're not afraid of accidentally confirming the real Seer and causing a reversal. So I believe Player 7's verification carries significant weight. For now, I'm siding with Player 7, but I'll carefully listen to the remaining players' speeches before making my final voting decision. If any player gives an exceptionally convincing speech today, I'll follow their lead in voting.

I expect more players to claim to be the Seer later, otherwise, if Player 7 becomes the only Seer, Player 8 would be the only confirmed good player, making Player 6 definitely a werewolf. I believe there will be another Seer claim from the later positions, so either Player 7 or the later Seer is a werewolf, while the other is the real Seer. Therefore, I think Player 5 in the earlier position must be a good player, and I'm also a good player. One of Player 2 and Player 3 must be a real villager. Based on the information from the speeches, we know that Player 7 and Player 8 are on the same side, while Player 6 and the player who will claim to be the Seer in the later position are on the same side. Player 9 said they support Player 7, but Player 9 can't distinguish between Player 6 and Player 8 as the real Witch, which is illogical. Since Player 7 declared Player 8 as a good identity, if Player 9 truly supported Player 7, they should believe Player 8 is the Witch and Player 6 is a werewolf. So I think Player 9 is a werewolf lying blatantly. Since Player 9 is a werewolf, I deduce that Player 7, whom Player 9 supports, is also a werewolf. Therefore, the real Seer is either Player 2 or Player 3 in the later positions. Player 7 declaring Player 8 as a good identity without fear of backfire suggests that Player 7 is confident, so I believe Player 8 is likely Player 7's werewolf teammate, making Player 6 the real Witch. In conclusion, I think Players 7, 8, and 9 are the three werewolves. Among Players 2 and 3, one is a villager and one is the Seer. Player 4 is the Hunter, Player 5 is a villager, and Player 6 is the Witch. That concludes my speech. This round, I'm voting for Player 9.",

I know some might question my Seer status, but I can clearly tell everyone that I am indeed the Seer. My task is to lead the innocent players to find the werewolves and achieve victory. From my perspective, the werewolf suspects are players 6, 7, and 9. Player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter against player 4, player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch against player 8, and player 7 is pretending to be the Seer. Firstly, player 6 claimed to be the Witch and gave player 9 a silver water, which I believe means players 6 and 9 are werewolves covering for each other. Secondly, since I am the real Seer, player 7 must be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, and in my view, player 9 claiming to be the Hunter is undoubtedly supporting their werewolf teammate, player 7. The werewolf team has already made their move, so I urge the innocent players not to be deceived. I am the true Seer, and I have shared my perspective with all the innocent players present. We have identified all the werewolf suspects. To be safe, I will check player 5 tonight. This round, I ask the innocent players to vote with me to eliminate player 7, the werewolf. Tonight, player 8, the Witch, should use the poison to kill player 6, the werewolf. Tomorrow, we can vote out player 9, the last werewolf, and the innocent team will win.",

However, when two players claim to be the Hunter, we must eliminate one of them on the first day. This is because the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, while the Seer cannot. Therefore, we need to prioritize resolving the true Hunter's identity on the first day, allowing the two Seers to report their verification information for one more day before making a decision.\n\nCurrently, players 4 and 9 claim to be the Hunter.\n\n- **Player 4**: First to speak, directly claiming the Hunter role. I believe if Player 4 were a werewolf, they wouldn't pretend to be the Hunter in the first speaking position, as the real Hunter in a later position would certainly speak up and attack Player 4. Based on this, I judge that Player 4 is likely the real Hunter.\n\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the Hunter and sides with Player 7. Player 7 identified Player 8 as a good identity, yet Player 9 stated in their speech that either Player 6 or 8, who are both claiming to be the Witch, is a werewolf. Player 9 completely ignores the objective fact that Player 8 is Player 7's good identity.

Since there are only three werewolves and three special roles in the game, the remaining No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 are all villagers.\n- Next, we'll analyze who the real seer is to determine the distribution of werewolves on the field.\n\n# Seer identity judgment:\n- **Player No. 7**: The judgment of No. 7's identity needs to start from No. 9's speech. No. 9 says he supports No. 7 but can't distinguish which one between No. 6 and No. 8 is the werewolf or the witch. However, No. 7 clearly states that No. 8 is a good identity based on his verification. If No. 9 truly supports No. 7, he should be able to clearly distinguish that No. 8 is the witch and No. 6 is the werewolf. No. 9 ignores the fact that No. 8 is No. 7's good identity, so I believe No. 9 is a werewolf with a problematic perspective. No. 9's purpose in pretending to be the hunter is to help his werewolf teammate charge forward, so No. 7, whom No. 9 supports, is undoubtedly a werewolf.\n- **Player No. 2**: Since I've determined that No. 7 must be a werewolf, there's no need to analyze No. 2's individual speech to distinguish why No. 2 is the seer. Because No. 7 is a werewolf, No. 2, who is competing with No. 7 for the seer role, is the real seer.\n\n# In conclusion, I support No. 2. Since No. 2 is voting for No. 7, to avoid split votes among the good team, I will vote for No. 7 to be eliminated this round.",

I find Player 4's speech to be standard, and typically, werewolves wouldn't pretend to be the Hunter in the first speaking position as it's not conducive to hiding their identity.\n\n- Player 9: They sided with Player 7, but believe that either Player 6 or 8 is a werewolf. However, Player 8 is Player 7's good identity. If Player 9 is siding with Player 7, then Player 8 must be good, so Player 9's logic is self-contradictory.

I hope the good people will carefully review Number 9's speech from yesterday.

How could Number 9 make such a logically flawed statement about there being a werewolf among Numbers 6 and 8, who both claimed to be the Witch? Moreover, no matter how eloquent a werewolf's speech may be, the voting pattern never lies. Number 9, the werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, voted for Number 4, the real Hunter. If Number 9 were truly my werewolf teammate, why wouldn't they vote for Number 2, the real Seer? Based on this analysis, Number 9 can only be a werewolf intentionally making mistakes during their speech to side with me. Number 9's goal was to get me, the real Seer, voted out. After the voting yesterday, Number 9 was eliminated without firing a shot. At that point, I had already identified all the werewolves: Numbers 6, 9, and 2. Since Number 8 is my good identity and claims to be the Witch, I absolutely trust Number 8's Witch identity. Therefore, Number 6, who also claims to be the Witch, must be a werewolf. As I am the Seer, Number 2, who also claims to be the Seer, must be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. I hope the good people won't assume that I, Number 7, am Number 9's werewolf teammate just because Number 9's speech was problematic.

With all three werewolves accounted for, player 7 had no need to verify player 1.

Therefore, player 9 made mistakes during their speech, revealing their werewolf identity. My view aligns with player 2's. Yesterday, player 9's purpose in pretending to be the hunter was to support their fellow werewolf, player 7. Players 7 and 9 are both werewolves. Therefore, I choose to side with player 2 as the true seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 2 is the true seer, and based on this, we can make further judgments.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 7**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 2.\n- **Player 9**: Is a werewolf pretending to be the hunter to support their fellow werewolf, player 7.\n\nBased on these conclusions, I decide to vote for player 7.",
