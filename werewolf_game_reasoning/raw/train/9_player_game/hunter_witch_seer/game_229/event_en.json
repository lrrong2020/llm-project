No. 9 died alone, which I think means they were a good person killed by werewolves, but it could also be a werewolf killing themselves. The only thing we can be sure of is that the witch is still alive because if No. 9 was the witch, they would have saved themselves or used their poison. So it's likely that all three special roles are still in play. If No. 9 was the seer who died, then we'll probably have a situation where a werewolf pretends to be the seer and becomes the only claimed seer. Anyway, since I'm speaking so early, I can't fully predict today's situation. Let's hear what No. 7 has to say about this!",

Player 6 mentioned that player 9 died alone, suggesting that 9 was either a good person killed by werewolves or a werewolf who killed themselves. I think this statement is redundant and adds no value. Moreover, player 6 made a common werewolf mistake - reversing cause and effect. They first said that player 9 could be a witch who would save themselves or use poison, then mentioned that there were three gods in play, and only after that suggested the possibility of 9 being a seer. This causal relationship is disordered. The normal sequence would be to first consider the witch possibility, then the seer possibility, and finally the possibility of how many gods are in play. Therefore, player 6 is a werewolf speaking with inside knowledge. I cannot tolerate player 7 considering player 6 as a good person, so the werewolf pit remains 5, 6, and 7. Given that players 5 and 8 both claim to be the hunter, the elimination order now focuses on 5 and 8's turns. I will vote for player 5 today.",

Last night, player 9 was attacked, but I think 9 is a werewolf who killed themselves, so I didn't use the healing potion. I hope my judgment is correct. Players 5 and 8 both claim to be the hunter. I believe 8 is the real hunter because 5's speech asked not to question his identity, saying he absolutely won't \"take off his clothes\" this game. By saying this, he subconsciously revealed he's not the hunter. Only good people claiming special roles would talk about \"taking off clothes\". However, good players also wouldn't claim to be the hunter in an early position, as it only confuses the villagers' perspective. So I deduce that 5 is a werewolf, which means 7, who gave 8 a bad identity, is also a werewolf. The werewolf suspects are 5 and 7. Seer 2 should check 6 tonight, because 6 directly assumed 5 was the hunter, possibly being 5's werewolf teammate or a villager without any information. This round, vote for 5. I'll use my poison on 7 tonight.",
