If Player 8 turns out to be a werewolf, we can directly vote them out. If Player 8 is a good person, I can still listen to their analysis of the situation and identity predictions. The result shows that Player 8 is indeed a bad identity. Now, Player 8, your best strategy would be to pretend to be a villager. Don't try to claim the Seer role against me. Instead, let others think that the real Seer is either Player 5 or 6, which might help you survive this round. If you insist on pretending to be a Seer against me, it will look very much like a werewolf forced to pretend to be a seer on the spot!\n\nAs I'm the second to last speaker, and no one before me has pretended to be a Seer, it suggests that there's likely a werewolf among Players 5 and 6. Although I think Player 3's patriotic speech sounds like a good person, Player 1, the Witch, shouldn't feel guilty about their actions. I will probably be targeted tonight, so if you can accept my claim as the Seer, please use your potion to save me tonight. Tomorrow, I will report the result of checking Player 9.\n\nI believe there's at least one werewolf among Players 2, 4, and 9. I'm inclined to think Players 2 and 4 are good because they've considered the possibility that a single Seer claim might be a werewolf.

My reasoning for checking Player 9 was to start with those close to me, as identifying a good player can help me gather votes, while finding a bad identity allows for immediate elimination. I must say this speaking order is extremely unfavorable for me, making a real Seer speak last and my confirmed good player speak first - it's truly a disastrous start!\n\nPlayer 1 claims to be the Witch, so I'll temporarily trust that. If tonight isn't peaceful or if Player 1 doesn't die tomorrow, then you, Player 1, should be immediately voted out!\n\nI believe Player 2's speech follows good player logic, also expressing doubts about Player 1's identity, so I consider Player 2 a good player.\n\nPlayer 3's speech shows good player reasoning, believing that the Witch rashly using poison on the first night is more likely to hit a good player than a werewolf. But don't worry, Player 3, your almighty Seer is still alive!\n\nPlayer 4's speech also has its own logical basis, aligning with good player reasoning. Since no one has pretended to be the Seer up to Player 4's position, I tentatively consider Player 4 a good player.\n\nI can only say that before Player 7, who is a werewolf, no one pretended to be the Seer, which can only mean a werewolf died last night. Either Player 5 or 6 is a werewolf!\n\nPlayer 7, a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, is limiting my survival space when I'm the only card left, giving me a bad identity check. Player 7 indicates they will likely be killed tonight, and if Player 1, the Witch, can save them, they'll report Player 9's check result tomorrow. If Player 1 is the real Witch with the potion still available, the werewolves would definitely target the Witch. Therefore, Player 7's logic is clearly confused, making me suspect that Players 1 and 7 might be werewolves who met during the night!\n\nOf course, to prevent werewolves from disguising as good players, I will check suspected werewolves tonight based on the voting pattern.\n\nToday, let's unanimously vote out Player 7, the werewolf pretending to be the Seer.",

Secondly, after accepting player 1 as the witch, player 7 still believes they will be killed at night. If player 1 is the witch with a potion, werewolves wouldn't be foolish enough not to target the witch. Therefore, I believe player 7 is a werewolf.

Therefore, we need to comprehensively judge who is the real Seer based on their speech attitudes, intentions, and whether their identity definitions for other players are reasonable.\n- **Player 7**: When Player 7 spoke to Player 8, asking them not to pretend to be a Seer but to claim to be a villager, it showed that Player 7's attitude was somewhat relaxed, as if voting out Player 8 was already a done deal. Moreover, Player 7 hastily acknowledged Player 1 as the Witch, which was rushed. Also, given that Player 7 already believed Player 1 to be the Witch, it's illogical to say \"I will be killed tonight\" because if Player 1 is the real Witch, they would certainly be targeted at night. Thus, Player 7's speech contains contradictions.\n- **Player 8**: Player 8 reasonably questioned Player 1's identity as the Witch, and believed that Players 2, 3, and 4, who also questioned Player 1's Witch identity, are good people. If we consider from the perspective that Player 8 is a werewolf, given that Player 7 is already trying to secure Player 1's vote, Player 8 as a werewolf has no reason to attack Player 1 and potentially lose the Witch's vote. Additionally, by identifying Players 2, 3, and 4 as good people, Player 8 is also limiting the werewolf team's own survival space. Therefore, Player 8's behavior doesn't seem like that of a werewolf.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe Player 8 is more likely to be the Seer, so I will vote for Player 7.",

Player 7 said, \"I checked player 8 because I wanted to verify nearby players, and 8 was more likely to speak after me.\" I believe player 7's reasoning for verification is fabricated, as player 8 could easily speak before player 7. Moreover, player 7 considers players 2, 3, and 4 as good, player 1 as the Witch, either player 5 or 6 as an eliminated werewolf, player 8 as a bad identity, so player 7 could directly assume player 9 (me) as the last werewolf, making it unnecessary to verify me. Player 7 can't even fully analyze the potential werewolf positions, likely making them a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n- **Player 8**: Gave player 9 a good identity. Their verification reasoning is very logical, commented on all players' speeches, carefully analyzed the situation, and suspected player 1 to be a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, which aligns with my thoughts. I believe if player 8 were a werewolf, giving player 9 a good identity while already being accused by player 7 would have no strength or benefit, which doesn't fit my definition of a werewolf's behavior. Therefore, I trust player 8 to be the real Seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 8 is the true Seer.\n# Werewolf possibility ranking:\n- 7 > 8\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 7.",

I don't even know if the information I reported was correct. Since I know I'm a good person, to prevent the real Witch from being eliminated between No.5 and No.6, I pretended to be the Witch to make the werewolf team think I was the real Witch. If the werewolf team kills me, whoever the Seer is can report one more day of verification information. However, No.8 died last night, so I think the information I reported yesterday was probably wrong and didn't match the werewolf team's kill information. So on the first day, No.6 was probably killed, and No.5 was poisoned by No.6, which means No.6 is the real Witch, and No.5 definitely isn't the Hunter, otherwise with three special roles eliminated, the game would be over! If we analyze based on No.5 being the eliminated werewolf, the werewolves killed No.8 today, so I voted for the wrong side yesterday by voting for No.8, falling into the werewolf trap. I apologize to everyone! Based on the judgment that No.8 is the Seer, No.9 is a good villager, No.1 is a villager, No.5 is likely a werewolf, No.6 is the Witch, No.7 is a werewolf, and the remaining two werewolves are among No.2 to No.4. Speaking to the good people present, if I, No.1, were a werewolf, pretending to be the Witch on the first day, then blatantly voting with my werewolf teammate No.7 for the real Seer No.8 in the last round, killing No.8 at night, and now giving up the Witch identity in my speech today, wouldn't I be too reckless as a werewolf? As a villager, seeing two deaths on the first night, I thought the Witch was probably already eliminated, so I pretended to be the Witch to intimidate the werewolf team a bit. But unfortunately, I didn't report the night information accurately. If I'm voted out today, it would play right into the werewolf team's hands. The werewolf team knows I'm a shield villager and deliberately didn't kill me at night, choosing to let us fight among ourselves during the day, making you trample me into the dust! I believe one of No.2, No.3, and No.4 must be a werewolf, and the remaining two werewolves are No.5 and No.7. I will vote based on the speeches of No.2, No.3, and No.4.

As number 9 said, if number 7 was the Seer who was voted out, then the werewolves could have simply killed the Witch and be done with it. The Witch can't save herself, so why would they risk killing one of their own to gamble on the Witch's potion? Moreover, yesterday's voting pattern reveals everything. Only number 1 followed number 7's lead, who was pretending to be the Seer, in voting for number 8. This proves that number 1 is definitely a werewolf. It seems that among numbers 5 and 6, who were eliminated on the first day, one was the real Witch who, after being stabbed, poisoned the other player. As a Witch, it's impossible not to save anyone for two consecutive nights. Can a Witch who doesn't even have a silver water still hold the Witch card? In my view, number 1's attempt to shed the Witch's identity this round is nothing but a clownish act. If you, number 1, were a villager, how could you casually assume the Witch's role yesterday to confuse the good people's perspective, influence their judgment, and even vote for the real Seer? Even if we take a step back and assume you're just a foolish villager, your series of actions still deserve the punishment of being banished! Now, the only uncertainty is whether there's another werewolf left besides number 1. In any case, the Hunter should hide well today. Let's vote out number 1, the werewolf, first.

Regardless, the werewolves now know the Witch died on the first night. Given that the Witch was already out and player 7, the real Seer, was voted out yesterday, there's no reason for player 8, if they were a werewolf, to kill themselves. So, the truth is: player 7, a werewolf, was voted out in the first round; player 8, the Seer, was killed on the second night; and the Witch was either player 5 or 6, eliminated on the first night. With both the Witch and Seer out, the lone Hunter needs to stay hidden, as we're unsure how many werewolves remain. If there are two, even if we vote out a werewolf today, the good team will still lose if the werewolves kill the Hunter tonight. Although player 1 is no longer pretending to be the Witch, the voting pattern shows they were the only one who followed the fake Seer werewolf in voting against the real Seer in the first round. Player 9 is now known to be player 8's good identity, and both players 7 and 8 defended players 2 and 4 on the first day. If either 2 or 4 were werewolves, they had every reason to vote against the real Seer, but they didn't. Therefore, player 1 seems most likely to be a werewolf this round. Even if you're good, you must face the consequences of your incorrect vote, and you haven't clearly analyzed which of players 2, 3, or 4 is the werewolf. In this crucial final vote, your speech has been extremely vague and lacks the depth of analysis expected from a good player! I'm voting for player 1 this round.

Otherwise, if the Witch had used the healing potion, it would have resulted in a peaceful night, which is very unfavorable for the werewolves. The fact that Player 1 is still alive while Player 8, the Seer, was eliminated, is enough to prove that Player 1 is not the Witch, but a werewolf pretending to be the Witch. Moreover, yesterday only Player 1 followed Player 7 (who is pretending to be the Seer) in voting for Player 8, which further confirms that Player 1 must be a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I have decided to vote for Player 1.",

Therefore, No. 1 is very likely to be a werewolf.\n- **Player No. 2**: On the first day, both No. 7 (the fake Seer werewolf) and No. 8 (the real Seer) protected them in their speeches. If No. 2 were a werewolf, voting out No. 8 would have clearly been more beneficial for the werewolves, but No. 2 didn't do so. Thus, No. 2 is most likely a good player.\n- **Player No. 4**: Similar to No. 2, they were protected by both No. 7 and No. 8 in their first-day speeches. If No. 4 were a werewolf, voting out No. 8 would have been more advantageous for the werewolves, but No. 4 didn't do this.
