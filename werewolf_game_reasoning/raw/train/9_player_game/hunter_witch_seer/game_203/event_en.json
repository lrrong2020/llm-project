After a night of deep contemplation and tossing and turning, I decided to check player 2, and God told me that this player 2 is a bad identity! You damned player 2, as a werewolf, doesn't your conscience hurt? Isn't your heart bleeding? As a werewolf, shouldn't you pay for your actions and your heinous deeds? You actually killed the respected Hunter, player 8, on the first night! Oh my goodness! This is simply unbelievable and inconceivable. I never thought that a respected Hunter from the good team, holding a big hunting rifle, would be eliminated by the werewolf team like this. My heart was instantly struck as if by five thunderbolts. After hearing this news, I felt very melancholy, painful, and deeply grieved. Fortunately, the Hunter has a passive skill and can randomly take out another player with his shot. I don't know the identity of player 6 who was taken out by player 8, but I hope player 6 is a werewolf. This would certainly be extremely advantageous for our good team. Addressing player 2, this big bad wolf, assuming all players eliminated on the first day belong to the good team, please stop acting and deceiving us good people, treating us like monkeys! Because you werewolves can already form a majority vote. But I believe that justice may be late, but it will not be absent. The elimination of player 2 today must be the responsibility and obligation of all good people! The true thought process of checking player 2 is not fabricated. I just checked the player next to me, and player 2 was the closest, so I casually checked him. If it turned out to be a good identity, it could help me gather votes; if it turned out to be a bad identity, I could directly vote him out. Player 2, I have something to say to you: The sea of bitterness has no bounds, turn back to the shore. And another saying: A prodigal who returns is more precious than gold. I advise you, player 2, to \"confess\" and admit you're a werewolf. As long as you honestly confess your mistake of killing Hunter player 8 today and vote for yourself, I will surely pray for your afterlife after you're eliminated. At the same time, I also address player 2's werewolf companions present: Don't cover for player 2 anymore. As the saying goes, when a prince breaks the law, he is punished like a commoner. Even if player 2 is the leader of your werewolf team, he should be punished for his mistakes! I suggest you join hands with me to exile player 2 and make up for your mistakes! Players 5 and 7, you two must belong to our good team, don't be confused anymore, trust me! I believe my speech today will surely move all the good people. Justice will eventually triumph over evil! My good companions, the time has come when the Seer needs you. Please join hands with me to exile werewolf player 2 during the day!",

            "context": "Player 4's speech is truly ridiculous. I, Player 4, am the only iron-willed Seer in this game! Last night, I checked Player 5 and found them to be a good identity. The logic behind checking Player 5 is simple: since they speak after me, if I had found them to be a werewolf, my credibility in giving them a bad identity would be reduced as I speak before them. If I found them to be good, they could use my speech to identify me as the Seer and help analyze the situation to find the werewolves. So, checking Player 5 was the best choice, both offensively and defensively. Player 5 indeed proved to be a good identity, as I expected. I hope Player 5 will speak well after me, and together we can vote out Player 1, who is pretending to be a seer!\n\nPlayer 1's speech is laughable. They keep accusing Player 2, but as a werewolf, don't they feel guilty? Doesn't their heart bleed? Shouldn't they pay for their evil deeds? It was them who killed the Hunter, Player 8, on the first night! Oh my goodness! They're falsely accusing others, truly the guilty party accusing first! I never imagined that the Hunter I admired would be attacked by werewolves on the first night. This news has shattered my beliefs! You werewolves are truly vicious and evil! If you had any courage, you'd face the Hunter in broad daylight instead of sneaking around at night!\n\nI urge Player 1's werewolf companions to \"lay down your knives and repent\"! Don't continue to collude with this despicable Player 1! Justice will prevail, but it will never side with evil! If you confess your crimes now, I might let you off today by voting out Player 1 first. But if you remain unrepentant, you'll face justice eventually! I hope all good players can see clearly and side with me!\n\nI think Players 5 and 7, who spoke before Player 1, seemed like ordinary villagers. Player 2 claims to be the Witch. I hope Player 2 isn't a werewolf working with Player 1, or their crimes will be even worse. Player 3 is also claiming to be the Witch, but I believe they're Player 1's werewolf partner. The current priority for elimination is Player 1, then Player 3. Player 1's speech was long-winded, empty, and illogical. Keeping them in the game would be an insult to the good players.\n\nTherefore, I call on all good players to raise their hands and vote out Player 1 first. Tonight, I'll check Player 2's identity. If Player 2 is good, then their Witch identity is confirmed, and tomorrow, Player 3, you'll follow Player 1's footsteps and be eliminated.",

We can only distinguish who the real witch is based on the witch counter-claims.\n\nNext, we need to distinguish between the real and fake witches.\n\n# Witch Identity Assessment:\n- **Player 2**: Believes player 1 is pretending to be a seer, points out that player 1's statement about players 5 and 7 being good is from a werewolf's perspective.\n- **Player 3**: Thinks player 2 is a werewolf, forcefully explains their decision not to save player 8, and directly tells players 5 and 7 to vote for player 2.\n- Based on the counter-claims of players 2 and 3 for the witch role, player 2's speech is superior to player 3's. Player 2 analyzed player 1's werewolf tells, noting their attempt to sway votes from players 5 and 7, which is a good player's perspective on speech analysis.\n- Player 3's speech didn't highlight this point and directly asked players 5 and 7 to vote for player 2.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 2 is the witch, which means player 1 who gave player 2 a bad identity is a werewolf, and player 4 is the real seer.
