If the witch decides to reveal herself, remember to indicate your intended target for poisoning tonight, and avoid conflicting with the seer's verification target for tonight. Number 9 claimed to be a villager but gave a vague speech, which could indicate either a passive villager or a werewolf. Number 1 claimed to be the hunter. If Number 1 is a werewolf, the real hunter in the later positions would likely reveal themselves to correct the perspective for the good team.

Although they haven't reported tonight's verification target, their analysis and logic are similar to my own judgments, so I consider player 3 to be the true Seer. Player 4, who also claims to be the Hunter, appears to me more like a werewolf who received a bad identity check and immediately pretended to be the Seer.

No. 4's response after being identified as a bad identity was very convincing, so I believe No. 4 is the real Hunter. I will side with any Seer who speaks after me. If no one claims to be the Seer later, then No. 3 must be the real Seer, and I will vote for No. 4 today. However, if someone does claim to be the Seer later, I will vote for whoever they identify as a bad identity. If they don't identify anyone as bad, I will vote for No. 3.",

My analysis: If players 1 and 3 were both werewolves, player 1 couldn't have known in advance that player 4 would claim to be the hunter after being declared bad identity, thus allowing their werewolf teammate (player 1) to claim hunter first. So, player 1's early claim as hunter carries significant weight.
