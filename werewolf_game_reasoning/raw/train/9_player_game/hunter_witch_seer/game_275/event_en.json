Player No. 1's logical thinking is clear and orderly, analyzing the situation from a good person's perspective, commenting on No. 9 and No. 7 who claimed to be villagers in earlier positions, and also arranging tasks for the Hunter. This demonstrates the perspective of a Seer, fitting my definition of one, so I believe No. 1 is the Seer. No. 3, 7, and 9 all claimed to be villagers, their identities cannot be determined. Since I judge No. 1 to be the Seer, No. 2 must be a werewolf, and No. 8, who is competing with No. 2 for the Hunter role, must be the real Hunter.

Player 1 is pretending to be a Seer and gave Player 2 a bad identity. Player 2 claims to be the Hunter, but I'm inclined to believe that Player 8 might be the real Hunter. If Player 8 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to be the Hunter from the second speaking position, so Player 8 is likely the true Hunter. I suspect that Players 1 and 2 might have planned during the night to use the \"werewolf identifying werewolf\" strategy, with Player 1 pretending to be the Seer and giving their werewolf teammate Player 2 a bad identity, while Player 2 claims to be the Hunter, all to increase Player 1's credibility. Today, I ask all good players to vote unanimously to eliminate Player 7. If I'm targeted tonight, I request the Witch to save me. If a player in a later speaking position is targeted, I ask the Witch to use the poison on Player 1 directly. Tonight, I will choose to verify either Player 2 or Player 8 to confirm my theory.",

            "reason": "Currently, we have a situation where two players are claiming to be the Hunter. Given that the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while the Seer cannot self-verify, we must prioritize eliminating one of the two claimed Hunters this round. This will allow us to distinguish between the real and fake Hunter, and give the two potential Seers (players 1 and 5) an extra day to report their verification information before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 2 and 8 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 8: Player 8 claimed to be the Hunter in the second speaking position. I believe that if player 8 were a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, there would be no need to hastily make this claim without receiving information about the true or false Seer's good or bad identity checks. Doing so wouldn't help their werewolf teammates establish their identities, offering no benefit. Therefore, I think player 8 is likely the real Hunter.\n\n- Player 2: Since I believe player 8 is the real Hunter, player 2 is probably a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter. Moreover, player 2 only claimed to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity by player 1, who is a potential Seer. This behavior is typical of a werewolf forced to pretend to be the Hunter after being exposed.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 8 is the real Hunter. I have decided to vote for player 2.",
