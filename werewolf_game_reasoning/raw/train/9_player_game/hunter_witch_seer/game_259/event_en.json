Now, we can only hope that Player 2 was the werewolf shot by Hunter 3, otherwise, it'll be very difficult for the good team to win!

Player 7 pretended to be the witch, while Player 8 pretended to be the seer and claimed I, Player 9, as a bad identity. It's terribly unfortunate that 8 happened to accuse me, the real witch, of being a werewolf.
