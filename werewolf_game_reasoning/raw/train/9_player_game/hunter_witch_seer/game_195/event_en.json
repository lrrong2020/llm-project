Last night, only No. 9 was eliminated. Since there's no Guard in the game, No. 9 must have been a good person killed by werewolves, and the Witch didn't save them. First, Werewolf No. 6, who's pretending to be a Seer, has already made mistakes during their speech. No. 6 thinks that since only No. 9 died, it's unlikely the Witch was eliminated. But if No. 9 were the Witch, why wouldn't they use their poison to prove their identity after being attacked? Would they really leave the game with both their potion and poison unused? No. 9 couldn't have been the Witch; the Witch must still be alive! Secondly, No. 6 directly assumed that No. 5, who's been inactive, might be good. This is not a well-thought-out conclusion. A Seer should identify other players' identities through verification, not baseless claims! As the Hunter, I've done my duty to analyze and expose No. 6's mistakes in pretending to be the Seer. Today, No. 6 must be eliminated no matter what. If you believe I'm the Hunter, vote for No. 6. If I'm unfortunately voted out, I'll immediately shoot No. 6! I believe either No. 3 or No. 4 is likely my great Seer; please confidently reveal yourself and lead the good team! If neither No. 3 nor No. 4 claims to be the Seer, then No. 9 must have been the Seer who was killed. If that's the case, I hope the good people don't vote incorrectly. Otherwise, if I'm also eliminated, we'll only have the Witch left as a special role. Once the werewolves identify the Witch's position, we'll lose completely! Today, please join me, the Hunter, in voting out No. 6, the werewolf pretending to be the Seer.",

As the Hunter, I need to consider whether Number 6 giving Number 2 a bad identity means Number 6 is the real Seer who identified Number 2 as a werewolf, or if Number 6 is a werewolf giving a bad identity to Number 2, who then chose to pretend to be the Hunter to elevate Number 6's status. This is still unclear. Number 4, who speaks last, if you are the real Seer, please vote with me against Number 2 this round! I urge everyone to vote with me, the true Hunter, to eliminate Number 2, the werewolf, to protect our village's safety and maintain peace and stability. As the Hunter, I must fulfill my duty!",

As for my speaking last, the speaking order is very unfavorable to me. First, the werewolves made a mistake by trying to frame player 2, and instead framed the Hunter. From my perspective as the Seer, player 2 must be the real Hunter! If you good people don't believe me, you can vote for player 2 and let the Hunter use their ability. Also, don't you think it's quite a coincidence? Player 2 claimed to be the Hunter, and player 3 immediately followed by also claiming to be the Hunter. Player 3 is a charitable werewolf gifted to us good people! The Hunter can take someone with them when they die. As for your previous analysis that player 9 is the Seer, that logic is incorrect. The werewolves didn't kill me, player 4, the Seer, during the night. Witch, please hide well, and if the werewolves choose to kill me, player 4, tonight, you must save me! Tonight I will choose to check player 8, because they were the first player to say that player 9 seemed like the Seer. So player 8's identity can only be revealed to the good people after I check them! Today I'm voting for player 6. Of course, I won't stop you from voting for the players in later positions, after all, there are two players claiming to be the Hunter. You can choose to vote for player 2 or 3, but my vote as player 4, the Seer, will definitely be on player 6!",

Player 6 (claiming to be the Seer) has identified Player 2 as a bad identity, while Player 4 (also claiming to be the Seer) has identified Player 6 as a bad identity. The vote this round will likely be between Players 2 and 6. If Player 3 were a werewolf, there would be no need for them to risk elimination. If Player 3 were a werewolf teammate of Player 6, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf team for Player 3 to hide their identity and only let Player 6 be eliminated.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe Player 3 is the real Hunter.

However, player 2's statement, \"Since there's no Guard, player 9 must be a good player killed by werewolves,\" has a logical flaw. On the first night, werewolves could choose to kill one of their own to deceive the Witch into using her potion. Therefore, we can't define player 9 as a good player solely based on their death.\n\n- **Player 3**: Also claims to be the Hunter. They address player 4, stating that if player 4 is indeed the Seer, they should also vote for player 2. Player 3 points out the flaw in player 2's speech, which leads me to believe that player 3 is the real Hunter, while player 2 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter.\n\nIn conclusion, I have decided to vote for player 2.",

However, when there's a hunter standoff, we must eliminate one of the two hunters on the first day. This is because hunters can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while seers cannot self-verify. Therefore, on the first day, we need to prioritize resolving the true and false hunter issue, allowing the two seers to report one more day of verification information before making a decision.\n\nCurrently, players 2 and 3 claim to be hunters.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be a hunter and believes player 6 is a werewolf. Player 2 immediately claimed to be a hunter after being identified as a werewolf, and directly assumed player 9 has a good identity, which is typical of a werewolf with night vision.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims to be a hunter and believes player 2 is a werewolf, while suspecting player 6 might be a werewolf. This aligns with good player logic and perspective. Player 3 also didn't directly assume player 6 is a seer, so I believe player 3 is the hunter.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 3 is the real hunter. I decide to vote for player 2.",

Player 2's speech contains logical flaws, blindly assuming player 9 is good. I believe player 2 has inside information. Therefore, player 2 might be a werewolf forced to pretend to be the Hunter for self-preservation.\n\n- Player 3: Declared themselves as the Hunter after seeing player 2 make the same claim. Player 2 immediately pretended to be the Hunter after being identified as a bad identity by player 6, and their speech contains logical flaws. Thus, the probability of player 3 being the true Hunter is higher than player 2.\n\nConsidering all this, I've decided to vote for player 2.",

Then Player 3, another werewolf teammate, pretended to be the Hunter, forcefully getting Player 2 voted out. Seeing the situation unfavorable, Player 4 avoided being the only Seer by also claiming to be one, declaring Player 6 as a bad identity. They even went as far as to kill themselves last night to trick me into using my potion and gaining my trust! I blame myself for being too naive and not seeing through the werewolves' scheme.\n\nThe werewolf team consists of Players 3, 4, and 6. This round, Player 4 even voted for their werewolf teammate, Player 3, to gain the trust of the good team. They're truly \"ascending to the throne\" by stepping on their werewolf companion's corpse!\n\nTo Players 1, 5, and 7, who are on the good team: Last night was peaceful, which means the Witch must have used their potion.
