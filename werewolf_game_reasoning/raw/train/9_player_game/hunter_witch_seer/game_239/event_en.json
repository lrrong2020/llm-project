When player 3 saw their werewolf teammate, player 2, receive a bad identity check, they immediately pretended to be the witch and gave player 2 a good identity to save them. Addressing player 3, even if player 2 is truly your good identity, isn't it possible that player 2 could be a werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the witch's potion? Player 3's immediate assumption that player 2 is the hunter, without any analysis, precisely indicates that players 2 and 3 have met during the night! Meanwhile, player 1 claims to be the witch and wants to hear the later-positioned player 2's response after receiving a bad identity check, which is consistent with the witch's perspective. Therefore, this round I will definitely side with player 7 as the seer and vote for player 2. Addressing players 5 and 6, one of whom is the last werewolf, don't bother pretending to be the seer anymore, revealing yourself now would be like walking into a trap!",

Players 8 and 1, who are werewolf teammates, are both pretending to be special roles. If Player 3 were a werewolf, there would be no need to come out and sacrifice themselves when the real Witch has already revealed themselves, so Player 3 can only be the true Witch. Player 1 claimed to be the Witch and said they saved me, Player 5, but in their speech, they referred to themselves as \"my Witch lord\" who gave me a second life. They asked me to reveal my identity and state my allegiance when I speak. This kind of speech doesn't match the compassionate mindset of a Witch at all, and lacks the perspective and logic of a good player. Therefore, Player 1 can only be a werewolf trying to pressure me about my identity. Today, Players 2 and 8 both claim to be the Hunter. I will vote for Player 8. I hope the good players can see that I am the real Seer and join me in voting to eliminate Player 8, who is a werewolf.",

Between Players 1 and 3 who both claim to be the Witch, one is a werewolf. I'm more inclined to believe Player 1 is the real Witch because their speech was more impartial and showed the Witch's perspective, expressing doubt about the identity of their saved player. Based on this, I judge that Player 3, who is competing with Player 1 for the Witch role, is a werewolf. Player 3 supports Player 5, so Players 3 and 5 might be werewolf teammates. Moreover, Player 5 directly assumes Player 2 is the Hunter, so Players 2, 3, and 5 might be the three werewolves. Therefore, Player 7 is the Seer, and Player 8 is the Hunter.

However, when two players claim to be the Hunter, we must eliminate one of them on the first day. This is because the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, while the Seer cannot. Therefore, we need to prioritize resolving the true and false Hunter issue on the first day, allowing the two Seers to report one more day of verification information before making a decision.\n\nCurrently, players 2 and 8 claim to be the Hunter, with the speaking order being 8 followed by 2.\n\n- **Player 8**: As an early speaker claiming to be the Hunter, I believe that if Player 8 were a werewolf, pretending to be the Hunter in an early position without choosing a side would have no benefit. Therefore, Player 8 is likely the real Hunter.\n\n- **Player 2**: After being identified as a bad identity by Player 7, Player 2 claimed to be the Hunter. Players 3 and 1 both claim to be the Witch, and Player 3 reported Player 2 as their good identity. Player 3's immediate assumption that Player 2 is the real Hunter without suspecting them of being a werewolf who killed their teammate significantly reduces the possibility of Player 2 being the Hunter. Therefore, I analyze that Players 2 and 3 are on the same side and are both werewolves.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 8 is the real Hunter. I decide to vote for Player 2.",

Given that the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while the Seer cannot self-verify, we must prioritize eliminating one of the two Hunter claimants this round. This will allow us to distinguish between the true and false Hunter, and give the two Seer claimants (players 7 and 5) an additional day to report their verification information before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 8 and 2 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- **Player 8**: Player 8 claimed to be the Hunter in the second speech. Typically, a werewolf wouldn't rashly pretend to be the Hunter in this early speaking position, which could be used for a low-profile speech. Even if it could lure out the real Hunter and get them voted out, the Hunter could still shoot and turn the tide for the good team, providing no benefit for the werewolves. Therefore, I believe Player 8 is likely the real Hunter.\n\n- **Player 2**: After being identified as a werewolf by Player 7, they immediately claimed to be the Hunter. It's a common tactic for werewolves to claim Hunter after being identified by the Seer. Moreover, Player 2's claim, coming after Player 8's, lacks the same level of conviction.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 8 is the true Hunter. I've decided to vote for Player 2.",

In the previous round, player 2 was eliminated without using their ability, so I believe player 2 must be a werewolf, which means player 8 is definitely the real hunter. At the same time, players 1 and 3 both claimed to be the witch in the last round, and player 3 was eliminated during the night, while player 1 wasn't. If player 1 is the witch, they would have definitely poisoned player 3, but why didn't the werewolf team kill player 1, the witch? Could it be that player 3 was the witch who didn't use the poison after being eliminated? I think in this situation, the werewolf team choosing not to kill anyone has no benefit, so player 3 must be the witch who chose to hold onto the poison. It seems I might have sided with the wrong player in the previous round. Given that the eliminated player 2 was a werewolf and player 8 is the real hunter, I deduce that player 7 giving player 2 a bad identity check means it's a werewolf checking another werewolf, and player 5 is the real seer. Since player 6's hidden identity is a villager, the remaining werewolves on the field must be players 1 and 7, and player 3 is the real witch. Based on this situation, I can only choose to change my stance and side with player 5 as the seer, and follow player 5's voting suggestion.",

No.2 was eliminated without using their ability, so No.8 is the real Hunter and No.2 is a werewolf.\n- No.1 and No.3 both claimed to be the Witch. Last night, No.3 died alone, which could mean either the Witch didn't use the poison, or the werewolf team didn't kill anyone. Since I believe the werewolf team not killing is less likely than the Witch not using poison, No.3's death was probably caused by the werewolf team, and No.3 didn't use the poison. Therefore, I conclude that No.3 is the real Witch, and No.1 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.\n- No.5 and No.7 both claimed to be the Seer. Based on No.3 Witch supporting No.5, and No.1 werewolf supporting No.7, I believe No.5 is more likely to be the real Seer.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for No.1, who was identified as a bad identity by No.5.",
