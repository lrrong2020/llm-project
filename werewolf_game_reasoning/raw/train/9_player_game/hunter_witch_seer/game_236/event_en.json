Player 2, who spoke first, mentioned feeling nervous. I believe Player 2 seems more like a werewolf. As a good person, one should be righteous and not nervous at all! Only werewolves who did something wrong last night would feel nervous! I think Player 5 will likely pretend to be a Seer, because werewolves don't want to expose too many of their teammates for the good side to vote out. Tonight, I will verify Player 2's identity.

At this point, I think Player 2 could be either a villager or a werewolf. Player 3 claimed to be the Seer and declared Player 5 as a bad identity, but Player 3 was too quick to attack Player 2 as a werewolf. Therefore, I believe Player 3 is likely pretending to be the Seer. This suggests that Player 2 is probably a good player that Player 3 is trying to frame.

Their high-priority speech accurately identified me as the Seer, which I'm unsure if it's luck or foresight. I hope the players who speak after me won't dismiss my claim as weak or accuse me of falsely declaring myself as the Seer right after being accused. Player 4 claims to be the Witch and supports me, the later-speaking Seer, so I firmly believe Player 4 is the true Witch as they're acting in the best interest of the good team.

If Player 3 were a werewolf, the probability of accurately targeting the Seer would be extremely low. Moreover, Player 4 is the only Witch in the game, so it's impossible for Players 3 and 4 to be a werewolf pair. This further disproves the theory that Player 3, being in an alternate position, could have targeted the Seer. Therefore, I believe Player 3 is the Seer, Player 5 is pretending to be the Seer, and Player 4 is the Witch. This round, I will follow Player 3's lead and vote to eliminate Player 5 as a werewolf.",

Firstly, regarding the speeches of players 3 and 5, player 3 gave a bad identity to one of the later players during their second speech, and coincidentally, player 5 pretended to be a seer. I believe player 3 is likely the real seer, while player 5 is a werewolf forced to claim the seer role. Player 4 claimed to be the witch and reported that I, player 9, am their saved target. I want to tell you, witch 4, that I'm not a werewolf who killed myself, I'm genuinely a villager. Player 5, pretending to be the seer, gave player 6 a good identity. Assuming player 5 is a werewolf, there are two possible explanations for player 6's good identity: first, player 5, as a werewolf, gave a good identity to a genuine good player in a later position to gain credibility; second, player 5 gave a good identity to their fellow werewolf, creating an ironclad werewolf that good players can't easily figure out. Player 6's first statement was that they're not the hunter. I ask you, player 6, as a good player with a villager identity, why would you make such a statement? Isn't this indirectly helping werewolves find the special roles? So, I can probably determine from this statement that you're likely a werewolf. However, your later speech supports the real seer, which in my eyes makes you a reverse-hook werewolf. Who would have thought that I, player 9, with my keen insight, would see through the schemes of players 5 and 6? This round, I support player 3 as the seer and will vote for player 5 as a werewolf. I hope the witch will use their poison on player 6 tonight!",

So far, no one has challenged player 4 and player 8 for the roles of Witch and Hunter, so I believe player 4 is the real Witch and player 8 is the real Hunter. I find player 2's speech a bit strange; he said that no matter what, his vote will definitely be for a werewolf this round. This kind of statement is odd and suggests he might be a werewolf with inside information. I think player 2 is likely a werewolf. Players 3 and 5 both claim to be the Seer, but I'm more inclined to believe player 3 is the real Seer. Player 5 jumped to claim the Seer role and immediately assumed player 4 was the Witch without considering the possibility of player 4 being a werewolf acting as bait. I think player 5's speech doesn't align with a Seer's perspective and lacks the thought process of a good player, so I believe player 5 is a werewolf.

Although No. 5's speech seems sincere, they claimed to be the Seer immediately after being accused by No. 3, so they could also be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer.\n- No. 6, after being identified as a good identity by No. 5, claimed to be a Villager but didn't choose to side with No. 5. For now, I believe No. 6 is a Villager.\n# Based on the speeches of the players in later positions, No. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 1 all sided with No. 3 and intend to vote for No. 5.
