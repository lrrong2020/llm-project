Player 9 made mistakes during their speech right from the start, committing a common error for werewolves - confused logical order. Player 9 began by expressing gratitude, which is like a cat crying over a dead mouse - false compassion. If the Witch had claimed that someone you thought was good was saved by the potion, then you'd have this known information, and thanking the Witch at that point would make logical sense. It's not coherent to thank the Witch for using the antidote when it's not yet confirmed if the werewolves killed one of their own to defraud the potion. Compared to player 8's speech, which I can tolerate, player 9's performance is clearly more exaggerated. I believe the villagers with no night actions will agree with me to vote player 9 out. If we can vote out player 9 today, I will check player 8 tonight. This is all I can do as a Seer to the best of my ability. I've commented on all the speeches of the players who spoke before me and explained in detail the suspicious points in player 9's speech. Today, villagers, vote with me for player 9.

My reasoning for checking player 7 was random; as the Seer, I can check whoever I want. Player 8's first speech was somewhat vague, but since they were the first to speak, we can be more lenient. I believe player 8 is a good person. Player 9's speech aligns with a good person's perspective and they also think player 8 is good, so I believe player 9 is also good. Player 1 first claimed to be a villager, then hinted at being the Witch. I think player 1 is subtly claiming to be the Witch, acting as a shield for the real Witch and is a good person. Player 2 is pretending to be a Seer and has accused player 9 of being a bad identity. Player 2's speech and claimed verifications are based on the daytime speaking order. Last night was peaceful, indicating the Witch used their healing potion. Whether it was a good person who was targeted or a werewolf who self-targeted, this provides more information for the good team. Player 7 isn't claiming any role here. If player 7 dares to claim to be the Witch, the real Witch should use their poison on them tonight. If player 7 claims to be the Hunter, we should all vote them out immediately; the real Hunter wouldn't even need to reveal themselves. Today, all good people should vote to eliminate player 7, and the Witch should poison player 2, who is pretending to be the Seer, tonight. I will check a suspected werewolf tonight. I will base my investigation on the speeches and votes to check potential werewolf teammates of players 2 and 7. As the Seer, my responsibility is to use my verification ability to lead the good team in finding and eliminating the werewolves.",

Well, that's like \"a mouse licking a cat's nose - seeking death!\" I'll use my poison on Player 1 tonight. Last night, my saved player was Player 7. Among the early speakers, Players 2 and 3 both claimed to be the Seer. I'm inclined to believe Player 2 is the real Seer. Player 2's speech was smooth and natural, with precise wording and strong persuasiveness, making it convincing. They also pointed out Player 9's suspicious behavior, which is exactly what I'd expect from a world-class Seer. Player 3's words weren't as fluent, making it difficult to clearly convey their points. They often used \"I think\" to make judgments, which makes it hard for us good players to trust them. A Seer should have clear insight and keen observation, not just guesses and assumptions, which fails to convince us that they're the Seer. I believe Player 2 is the Seer, and we've identified the werewolf suspects as Players 1, 3, and 9. I'll use my poison on Player 1 tonight.",

I think both analyses were quite thorough, but I find Player 2 slightly more convincing for the following reasons: First, Player 5 claimed to be the Witch and said Player 7 was attacked last night. If Player 7 were a werewolf, there would be no need for Player 5, as their teammate, to make such a claim. So I believe Player 3's purpose in claiming to be the Seer was to force the Witch to reveal herself. I think Player 2 is the real Seer, Player 3 is a werewolf, Player 5 is the Witch, and Player 7 is a good player who was saved by the Witch after being attacked by the werewolves!",

When I saw the speaking order, my heart sank halfway, and after Player 3, who is pretending to be a Seer, gave me a bad identity, the remaining half of my heart completely froze! My thoughts this round are very clear because all three werewolves have been identified so far. In my view, Players 2 and 3 are both werewolves, and among Players 1 and 5 who are both claiming to be the Witch, one is a werewolf and the other is the real Witch. Player 5, claiming to be the Witch, reported me as her saved target. Given that Player 5, who is likely the Witch, and Player 6 both consider me to be good, my identity is now quite credible. If I were a werewolf, there would be no need for me to claim to be the Seer and put myself in the voting round, so I can only be the real Seer. I hope the good people can understand this logic! I hope the good people can carefully analyze the situation this round and recognize that I am the true Seer you're looking for. Let me arrange the work ahead: Players 1 and 5 are both claiming to be the Witch, you'll resolve the Witch issue tonight. Because Player 3, who is pretending to be the Seer, gave me a bad identity, I will definitely vote for Player 3 this round, and tomorrow we'll vote to eliminate Player 2!

However, knowing that I am a werewolf, Player 9 is not my werewolf teammate. So Player 2 is likely a hunter who randomly claimed to be a seer but isn't afraid of being eliminated because the hunter can shoot a suspected werewolf when eliminated.\n- Player 7 claims to be a seer and declares Player 8 as a good identity. Player 7's verification result is correct, as Player 8 is not my werewolf teammate. So Player 8 is indeed a good person, which means Player 7 is most likely the real seer.\n- Player 3 claims to be a seer and declares Player 7 as a bad identity. Player 3 is my werewolf teammate who accurately targeted Player 7, the real seer.\n\nPros and cons analysis:\n- Voting for Player 7: The advantage is that Player 7 is the seer. Eliminating Player 7 ensures that a god role is out, giving us werewolves an advantage and making it easier to win the game.\n- Voting for Player 2: The disadvantage is that Player 2 is likely a fearless hunter. Voting them out might result in them taking one of us werewolves with them, causing both a god role and a werewolf to be eliminated, which doesn't give us an advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, if Player 7 is eliminated, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf team.

            "reason": "First, we need to distinguish between the real and fake seers on the field.\n\n# Seer Identity Assessment:\nCurrently, players 2, 3, and 7 claim to be seers. The speaking order is 2, 3, 7.\n\n- **Player 2**: Gave player 9 a bad identity. Player 9 is the second speaker this round, so it's understandable that not much information can be analyzed. Player 2 attacks player 9 as a werewolf who made mistakes during the speech solely based on 9's \"gratitude\" towards the witch, and even uses this to determine that 9's logical order is chaotic. I believe player 2 is forcefully attacking player 9 and doesn't fit the seer's perspective.\n\n- **Player 3**: Gave player 7 a bad identity. In player 3's speech, they directly consider player 9 as good without analyzing the possibility of players 2 and 9 being werewolves checking each other. I think player 3's logic is flawed and lacks the cautious thinking attitude of a seer.\n\n- **Player 7**: After receiving player 3's bad identity, they immediately pretended to be a seer and gave player 8 (me) a good identity. Firstly, player 7 giving me a good identity undoubtedly gained my favor. Additionally, if player 7 were a werewolf, there would be no need to expose their perspective by pretending to be a seer in the last position, as most good players would use the logic of \"eliminating all three seer claimants in order\". Therefore, player 7's courage to claim seer indicates they are likely the real seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 7 is the real seer.\n\n# Werewolf Probability Ranking:\n- 3 > 2 > 7\n\n# What I Should Do Now:\n- **Vote for player 3**: Since seer 7 spoke last and clearly called for votes against player 3, although from my perspective both players 2 and 3 are pretending to be seers, I must follow the seer's lead and vote for player 3 to avoid split voting.\n\nIn summary, I decide to vote for player 3.",

Therefore, the first player to claim Seer, No. 2, can only be either the real Seer or a werewolf.\n- If No. 2 is the real Seer, then No. 3 and No. 7 are both werewolves pretending to be the Seer.\n- If No. 2 is a werewolf, then No. 3 and No. 7 could both be their werewolf teammates also claiming to be the Seer.\n- However, if No. 7 were a werewolf, given that No. 5 (the Witch) has given No. 7 a good identity, and most players believe No. 7 is likely a villager, there would be no need for No. 7 to claim Seer when their werewolf teammate in an earlier position has already done so.\n- Based on this, I conclude that No. 7 is most likely the real Seer.\n\nRanking of werewolf possibility:\n- No. 3 > No. 2 > No. 7\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for No. 3.",

Yesterday, I believed that players 2 and 3 were two werewolves pretending to be Seers, and one of the players 1 and 5 claiming to be the Witch was also a werewolf. I had already identified all my werewolf suspects. Last night, I actually had no one left to check, as I believed all the players in later positions were good. Player 4 voted for me in the last round, so I thought 4 might be a good player who sided with the wrong team. I decided to check player 4 last night, and surprisingly, 4 turned out to be a werewolf! It wasn't until I saw that player 2 had shot player 9 this morning that I realized player 2 was the Hunter! I don't understand why player 2, as the Hunter, gave player 9 a bad identity check. Perhaps he thought player 9's speech sounded like a werewolf? Since player 2 could use his gun after being killed, player 5 must be the werewolf poisoned by the Witch. The truth is now clear to everyone: players 3, 4, and 5 are the three werewolves. In this round, if the good players vote for player 4 along with me, we can achieve a great victory!",

When a non-Seer good player randomly claims to be the Seer, it only affects the judgment of other good players, while the werewolves can just sit back and watch the show. They watch the good players fight among themselves in chaos, and the werewolves reap the benefits - it's utterly ironic! I can't comprehend Number 2 Hunter's behavior. I believe Number 9 was likely a wrongly accused good player, yet they also died by the Hunter's gun! Number 4 claimed yesterday that they wouldn't take sides or dare to attack any player, which clearly shows they were preparing to watch from the sidelines! Today, you claim to be the Witch - do you think anyone will believe you? Number 4 claims to be the Witch and votes for the real Seer, while Number 6, who also claims to be the Witch, votes for the fake Seer werewolf. So I definitely believe Number 6 is the Witch, and Number 4 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch!
