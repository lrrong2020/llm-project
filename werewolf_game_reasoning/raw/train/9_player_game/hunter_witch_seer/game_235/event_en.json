However, we can't immediately determine whether player 6 is the witch or a werewolf pretending to be the witch just from their first-round speech in the leading position. I need to comprehensively judge based on whether anyone in the later positions claims to be the witch. For high-position players claiming to be special roles, I won't blindly believe they are genuine. I'm not referring to you, player 7, please don't misunderstand. It's understandable that you sided with player 6 as the witch since you received their good identity. Assuming player 6 is the witch, I hope you can accurately use your poison to kill a werewolf this round. Before poisoning a suspected seer or their good identity, remember to poison the suspected seer first. Since the early-position players 6 and 7, both suspected special roles, have expressed their intention to reveal their identities, I'll be straightforward too - I'm a villager. The reason I'm responding to these two special roles' call is that deep down I feel they are the witch and the hunter. But even if I feel they might be genuine, I still have to verbally say that player 6 is either the witch or a werewolf, and player 7 is either the hunter or a werewolf, because I have the ability to think cautiously and think like a good person. Let's listen to the speeches of the true and fake seers in the later positions. Voting is my only power, and I will vote to eliminate the werewolf in my mind!",

My thought process for checking Player 8 was to verify someone near me; if they turned out to be good, they could help me gather votes, and if they were bad, I could immediately vote them out. Last night was peaceful, and the Witch has already used her healing potion. I believe that if Player 6 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to be the Witch when no one is contesting the Seer role. If Player 6 were a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, then the real Witch wouldn't need to reveal herself today and could simply poison Player 6 tonight. Therefore, I think Player 6 is likely the real Witch, as there's no advantage for a werewolf to falsely claim this role. Player 7 claimed to be the Hunter early in the speaking order. I believe if Player 7 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to be the Hunter when no one is contesting the Seer role, so I think Player 7 is probably the real Hunter. This round, I ask all good players to vote with me against Player 8, the werewolf. Player 8's speech was full of nonsense without any logical output, and I'm sure everyone can see that Player 8 is a werewolf with information. Player 8 is someone who can clearly see the true special roles but doesn't dare to support anyone! I will choose to verify another player's identity after hearing everyone's speeches and seeing the voting results. Everyone, please don't split the votes; join me in lynching Player 8, who I've identified as bad!",

Player 7, speaking second, immediately claimed to be the Hunter. Given that Player 7 is the Witch's silver water, I think if Player 7 were a werewolf, they could have easily coasted on their silver water status and hidden their identity. There was no need to directly claim the Hunter role, which would inevitably cause the real Hunter to reveal themselves and provide the good team with correct information. Thus, I believe Player 7 is the Hunter. Player 8 said that even if they deeply felt these two players were genuine gods, they would still verbally claim that Player 6 is either not the Witch or a werewolf, and Player 7 is either not the Hunter or a werewolf. I think Player 8 is \"playing dumb while knowing the truth.\" Player 8's ambiguous speech is very much like that of a werewolf with inside information! As a villager, I don't have much insight, but given Player 8's explosive speech, I can only side with Player 9. I vote to eliminate Player 8, the werewolf.",

After hearing the speeches from the players before me, I feel this game is very exciting. I believe Player 6 is the Witch and Player 7 is the Hunter. As we all know, the Witch and Hunter are powerful roles in the good team, both able to prove their identities. Werewolves wouldn't rashly pretend to be these powerful roles, as it brings no benefit to the werewolf team and is tantamount to suicide. After hearing Player 8's speech, I can only say it was \"brilliant\". It seems Player 8 is very confident, perhaps even overconfident. I believe Player 8 is an upright good person. I think Player 1's speech can be considered as coming from a good person, but please, Player 1, don't lose your judgment as a good person just because of Player 8's speech! However, I'm afraid I can't believe Player 2 is good. Player 2's speech was too brief and didn't analyze the situation from a good person's perspective, unlike what a thoughtful good person would do. I think the werewolf suspects are Players 2, 4, and 9. As the Seer, I've shared my perspective with the good team. Please, good people, don't choose the wrong side. This round, follow me, the Seer, to vote out Player 4, the werewolf. Player 6, the Witch, should use the poison on Player 9 tonight.",

I believe there's no need for such extensive analysis of players 6 and 7 when no one is contesting their roles. Therefore, I think player 9's perspective doesn't align with that of a true seer.\n\n- **Player 3**: Declares player 4 as bad identity. Player 3's judgment of the field situation and comments on the speeches of players in earlier positions are very objective and clear, with a lucid perspective. Thus, I believe player 3 is the true seer, while player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Since player 3, the seer, has identified player 4 as a werewolf, I will follow player 3's lead and vote for player 4.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for player 4.",

Therefore, I believe Player 8 is either a villager or a werewolf.\n- **Player 3**: Player 3 claims to be the seer, blindly protects Player 8 based on their speech, directly considering them as a good person. I think Player 3's identity is less credible than Player 8's.\n- **Player 5**: Player 5 claims to be a villager, supporting Player 3 and accusing Players 4 and 9 of being a werewolf pair. I think Player 5's attack on Player 4 has a \"logical collapse\" that's too exaggerated. This seems to be a forced attack on Player 4, so I suspect Player 5 might be Player 3's werewolf teammate, strongly siding with Player 3.\n# Werewolf possibility ranking:\n- 3 > 5 > 8 > 9.\n# Final voting reason:\n- This round, both Players 3 and 9 claim to be the seer. I can't accurately judge who the real seer is. If I hastily vote for either Player 3 or 9, I might mistakenly eliminate the true seer, leading the good team to failure. Additionally, we must vote between Players 4 and 8, who were given bad identities by Players 3 and 9 respectively.\n- I believe Player 8 is more likely to be a werewolf than Player 4, so I choose to vote for Player 8.\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 8.",

I believe if player 9 were a werewolf, there would be no need to declare player 8 (who has already spoken and claimed to be a villager) as a bad identity, especially with player 6 claiming to be a witch and player 7 claiming to be a hunter. They could have easily declared a later-position player as a bad identity to challenge the real seer, which would be more beneficial for werewolves. Therefore, I think player 9 is likely the true seer.\n\n- **Player 3**: As a later-position seer, they declared player 4 as a bad identity. Player 3 concluded that player 8, who was declared as a bad identity by player 9, must be good. I think player 3's conclusion about player 8's identity is too hasty. Therefore, I believe player 3 is likely a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 9 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Assessments Based on the Seer's Information:\n- **Player 3**: A werewolf challenging player 9's seer claim.\n- **Player 8**: A werewolf identified by seer player 9.\n\nBased on these assessments, I decide to vote for player 8.",
