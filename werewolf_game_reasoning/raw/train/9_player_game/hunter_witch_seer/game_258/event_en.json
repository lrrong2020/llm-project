It would have been more impactful for player 7 to declare the adjacent player 8 as a bad identity.

Therefore, I trust that player 7 is the Seer.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be the Seer, declares player 1 as a good identity. Player 1 claims to be the Witch and declares player 9 as their silver water. I believe there's a high possibility that players 1 and 9 are two werewolves mutually establishing their identities. Furthermore, player 9's speech is brief and superficial, without commenting on the players who spoke before them, lacking a Seer's perspective.
