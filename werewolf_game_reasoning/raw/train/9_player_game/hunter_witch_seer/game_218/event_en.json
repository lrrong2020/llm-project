Their verification strength isn't very convincing. As we all know, we good people are natural enemies with werewolves, so why would you ask werewolves to go easy on you? Did you drink with Player 9 the witch? What kind of speech is this? If you two had even a little food, you wouldn't have gotten this drunk.

If Player 1 were a civilian without night actions, it would be impossible for them to obtain this information, so Player 1 is likely a werewolf.\n- No one else claimed to be the Seer against Player 2, making Player 2 the unopposed Seer who identified Player 1 as a bad identity. Excluding the possibility of Player 5 or 6 being the Seer, it's likely that Player 2 is the real Seer who identified Player 1 as a werewolf.\n- Even if Player 2 is a werewolf, and either Player 5 or 6 who were eliminated was the real Seer, Player 1's speech is still problematic. So Player 1 and Player 2 might be playing the \"werewolf identifying werewolf\" strategy. In this case, voting for Player 1 is still the correct choice.\nTherefore, I conclude that Player 1 must be a werewolf, while Player 2 could either be the Seer or a werewolf.
