It's not a role-playing game. Players 8 and 9, there's no need to immerse yourselves so deeply into your game roles. You can openly coast through the game and just say you're done speaking, instead of rambling on with irrelevant chatter. If the Witch can't decide who to poison, she might as well choose between 8 and 9, since you both claim to be villagers anyway. Your lives are expendable, so it's no great loss even if she poisons the wrong one. My strong intuition tells me that player 2 is the Seer. I hope in this round you'll reveal your verification information, discuss your definition of the front positions, indicate who you'll check tonight, suggest who the Witch should poison, whether the Hunter should reveal themselves tomorrow, who to vote for today, and your overall assessment of my identity based on my speech. If you fail to address even one of these points, I'll cast my vote against you.",

The real Hunter doesn't even need to reveal themselves; we'll just vote out Player 4 today to prevent the werewolves from identifying the Hunter's position. If Player 4 claims to be a villager, let their teammates try to save them, which would expose two werewolves. We'll vote out Player 4 today, and tonight the Witch can poison the werewolf pretending to be the Seer. As the Seer, my responsibility is to use my verification ability to lead the good team to victory. After nightfall, I'll check suspected werewolves. I believe Player 2 is good because their thoughts align with mine. Players 8 and 9 spoke before me and didn't pretend to be the Seer; their speeches were quite humorous, so I think they're good.

            "context": "Good afternoon, everyone. I am a brave hunter. The situation on the field has become chaotic, so let me clarify things for the good team! Player 4 claimed to be the witch after receiving a bad identity. Player 4, who is your silver? I remember last night was peaceful, yet you didn't even report your silver. How can we good people trust your witch identity? Player 4's speech is glib, with one excuse after another, but without any useful information. I believe Player 4 is likely a werewolf trying to lure out the real witch after being identified as bad! The early-position Players 8 and 9 are \"role-playing,\" but their speech states are quite relaxed. For now, I consider both Players 8 and 9 to be good. Player 1's comments on Players 8 and 9 were fine in the first half, but then Player 1 suggested that the witch could randomly poison either Player 8 or 9 since they both claimed to be villagers, and it wouldn't matter if the wrong one was poisoned. I disagree with this. Aren't villagers' lives valuable? What if the werewolves start killing villagers? I think Player 1 is likely a werewolf trying to get the witch to poison a good person! Player 2's comments on Player 1 were quite fair, so I believe Player 2 is good. As the hunter, I'm taking the lead and siding with Player 3 as the seer. Player 3's speech was logical, sincere, and eloquent - exactly how I imagine a legendary seer would speak! Today, the witch doesn't even need to reveal herself. Let's vote out Player 4, who was identified as bad, first.",

His speech was like a resounding bell, enlightening me. 3's speech was nearly perfect, completely matching my image of a great Seer, as my perspective aligns with his. First, I think 8 and 9 are villagers. If either 8 or 9 were werewolves, they would have made moves in their advantageous early speaking positions, which isn't typical werewolf behavior. So I believe 8 and 9 are passive villagers. 1 suggested that villagers' lives are expendable and the Witch can poison either 8 or 9 at will. This forcefully paints 8 and 9 as werewolves. I don't think a good person would say what 1 said; it's too bloodthirsty. As good people, we should work together to find the werewolves, not have the Witch poison good people at night. So I suspect 1 might be a werewolf. Player 4 has already made mistakes during their speech. How can they claim to be the Witch without revealing who they saved? This doesn't earn our trust as good people. This round, I'll side with 3 and vote for 4 to be eliminated.",

If Player 4 were the real Witch, they would have reported saving someone last night. However, Player 4 didn't report any saved player during the peaceful night, so they are likely a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.\n- Based on this, I conclude that Players 3 and 4 are werewolves accusing each other.\n\nAnalysis of the current situation and pros/cons of not claiming to be the Seer:\n- Since everyone believes Player 8 (my good identity) is good, they won't be voted out even if I don't reveal my verification.\n- As Players 3 and 4 are werewolves accusing each other, the werewolf team will vote for Player 4 to strengthen Player 3's fake Seer claim. So Player 4 will definitely be lynched.\n- Advantage: By not claiming to be the Seer, if the werewolves haven't identified me through my speech on the first day, I can verify one more identity, which will be more beneficial for the good team.\n- Disadvantage: If the werewolves find and kill me, my first night's verification will be lost, and the good team might collectively believe Player 3 is the Seer. However, I believe my speech is sufficient to hide my Seer identity.\n\nIn conclusion, to conceal my Seer identity and still get Player 4 (werewolf) lynched, I will vote for Player 4.",
