I think Player 1's verification carries significant weight.

Player 2 claims to be a villager and their speech is standard. I cannot define Player 2's identity, so I suggest that Player 1, as the Seer, should verify Player 2 during the night.

If player 8 contradicts player 1's claim and also claims to be the Seer, then there's nothing else to discuss - we should vote for player 1 immediately. If player 8 claims to be a villager, I will vote for one of the players who claimed to be villagers earlier. We know that players 2, 3, and 4 all supported player 1, while player 6 didn't. However, player 6 also didn't attack players 2, 3, and 4 for supporting player 1. This clearly doesn't align with the normal thought process of a good player, so I will primarily consider player 6 as a werewolf. Only player 5 has claimed to be the Witch, and I believe this claim. I suggest that player 5, as the Witch, should try to identify the werewolf among players 2, 3, and 4, and choose one of them as the target for the poison tonight.",

However, Player 8 turned against this and claimed to be the Seer, resulting in two players claiming to be the Seer. One of them must be the real Seer. Before considering Player 8 as a werewolf, we need to consider that Player 1, who verified Player 8 as good, might be a werewolf. Therefore, from a logical priority perspective, Player 1 can only be a werewolf.\n\nBased on this analysis, I decide to vote for Player 1.",

Player 8 then betrayed us and established their credibility. Before considering Player 8 as a werewolf, we must first consider Player 1, who gave Player 8 the good identity, as a werewolf. Analyzing the logical priority, Player 1 can only be a werewolf. Therefore, the good players will certainly identify my werewolf teammate, Player 1, as a fake seer. If I don't vote for Player 1 at this point, I will likely expose my own werewolf identity. I might even be poisoned by the Witch tonight or lynched tomorrow during the day. To continue concealing my identity, I am forced to vote against my werewolf teammate, Player 1.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 1.",
