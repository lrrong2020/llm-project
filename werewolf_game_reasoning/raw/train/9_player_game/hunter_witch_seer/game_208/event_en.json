No one has claimed to be the witch at my position, which suggests that either player 6 or 9 was the witch who was forced to use the poison to prove their identity after being attacked, killing the other player. The earlier speakers, players 2, 3, 4, and 7, all claimed to be villagers. I know I'm a villager, so there are 5 players claiming to be villagers. Excluding the possibility of the hunter pretending to be a villager to avoid being killed by werewolves, it's highly likely that two werewolves are among players 2, 3, 4, and 7!\n\nI believe player 8 is the seer. If 8 were a werewolf pretending to be the seer, they could have easily declared me (player 1) as a bad identity, which would have been hugely beneficial for them. This way, 8 could either accurately challenge the real seer or establish themselves as the unopposed seer and vote out a good player. However, 8 declared the eliminated player 9 as a good identity, so I think 8 is the real seer.\n\nAmong the four players who claimed to be villagers earlier, I think players 2 and 7 are most likely werewolves. Player 2 started by saying that the deaths of 6 and 9 weren't their doing, but were caused by later players. This kind of speech makes me think that 2 is desperately trying to defend themselves! If you didn't cause the deaths of 6 and 9, then of course it must have been the later players, so why do you say you \"think\" it was the later players? I believe player 2's speech is too explosive, close to making mistakes during the speech!\n\nPlayer 7 directly attacked player 5 as a werewolf just because 5 didn't reveal their identity. I don't understand this either. In a situation where two players died last night, shouldn't the special roles try to hide their identities? You, player 7, are nothing more than a villager or lower role!\n\nI think player 2 is almost certainly a werewolf who made mistakes during their speech, and player 7 might be a werewolf. Player 2 seems more obviously a werewolf than player 7. I will vote for player 2 to be eliminated!",

I think it was someone who spoke after me. Whoever did it, please confess!\" This is Player 2's speech, but it's almost impossible for a werewolf to directly admit their identity. Player 2's speech is both ridiculous and absurd, and it reveals a guilty state of mind. I can't understand why a good person would make such a statement, so I believe Player 2 is a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 4**: Player 4's speech is even more outrageous than Player 2's. Player 4 thinks that because Players 2 and 3 didn't claim any roles, they must both be good people. Following this logic, Player 4 should consider all players who didn't claim roles as good people. A good person wouldn't conclude that Players 2 and 3 are both good based solely on the fact that they didn't claim roles. I think Player 4's reason for defending these players is too hasty and doesn't seem to be the result of logical deduction. It's more like a werewolf who knows everyone's identity during the night phase.\n\nRanking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 2 = 4\n\nInitially, I was going to vote for Player 4, but I think Player 1's speech sounds like a good person, and Player 1 also voted for Player 2, whom I suspect to be a werewolf.

Players 2 and 8 are both werewolves. Player 7 strongly supports Player 8's fake Seer claim. Today, Player 7 is attacking me, the real Seer, claiming I'm a werewolf, which likely means Player 7 is also a werewolf charging in to support Player 8.
