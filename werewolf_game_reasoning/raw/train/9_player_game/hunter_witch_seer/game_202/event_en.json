I think Number 7's speech is satisfactory. In contrast, Number 9, who claimed to be the seer from a later position, ended their speech with just a few sentences. They didn't comment on the bad identity given by the player pretending to be the seer, nor did they analyze whether the eliminated Number 4 was good or a werewolf. Moreover, why can't werewolves give good identities to eliminated players? If that's the case, in the future, if werewolves directly give good identities to eliminated players, wouldn't it be impossible for good players to choose the right side? I think Number 9's speech is unsatisfactory, and Number 9 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the seer. For now, I'm leaning towards Number 7, with Number 5 being the bad identity, but I haven't fully sided with Number 7 yet. I still want to hear Number 5's speech before making a final decision.

Could No. 9 be No. 1's werewolf partner, with No. 7 and No. 9 being a werewolf duo pretending to be seers? I don't believe No. 1 is a good person who would rashly claim to be the Hunter to protect me, especially since he doesn't know how No. 4 and No. 8 were eliminated. Although I received a bad identity check from No. 7, who's pretending to be a seer, I don't want to side with No. 9. No. 1's actions have made me wary of No. 9's seer identity. I think there's a possibility that either No. 4 or No. 8 was the eliminated seer, and No. 9 is a werewolf who claimed to be the seer later. No. 9's independent speech also gave a very bad impression. No. 9 thinks that if he were a werewolf, there would be no need to give a good identity to the eliminated players in the earlier positions, so he must be the real seer. I want to say that this logic doesn't prove you're the seer at all, because you could also be a werewolf deliberately doing this, knowing this logic, to make the players in later positions think you're probably the seer. So now, in my view, the probability of No. 9 being the seer is only about 30-40%, which is relatively low. I strongly agree with and support No. 2's reasons for targeting No. 9, and I believe No. 2 is a good person on the same side as me.

Based on my belief that 7 is the Seer, 5 must be a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, while 1 is the real Hunter. I think if 1 and 7 were on the same team, 1 wouldn't need to claim to be the Hunter in an earlier position to support 9. Therefore, 1 and 7 are unlikely to be werewolf teammates who know each other.

Moreover, stating that if they were a werewolf, they wouldn't give a good identity to an eliminated player is bewildering. I think No.9 is likely a werewolf.\n- **Player No.1**: Claimed Hunter in the front position, gave a standard speech, and sided with No.9.\n- **Player No.5**: Claimed Hunter after receiving the bad identity, believed the real Seer is likely eliminated, and didn't side with No.9. No.5's perspective is puzzling because they think \"No.4 or No.8 is the eliminated Seer, and No.9 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer\".
