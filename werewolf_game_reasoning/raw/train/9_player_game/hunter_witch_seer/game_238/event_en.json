Therefore, I must stand up to give all good players the correct perspective.

They claimed that Player 7 couldn't claim any role, and that werewolves could claim any role they wanted, stating that werewolves have the most flexibility in the game. This statement from Player 6 is certainly inappropriate. Moreover, Player 6 even suggested that the Hunter should hide. My goodness! There's no need for a powerful role like the Hunter, who can prove their identity and potentially initiate a \"shootout,\" to hide. I can't believe anyone would side with Player 6 after such an exaggerated statement.\n\nHowever, as the Seer, I'll allow you to side with Player 6 for one round, just one round! Because today, whether you side with Player 6 or me (Player 2), we'll be voting out Player 7, as I've verified that Player 7 is a werewolf. Haha! The strategy of Player 6 and 7, where one werewolf pretends to be the Seer and declares the other as a bad identity, has completely fallen apart because I checked Player 7's identity on the first night! When I saw Player 6 declare Player 7 as a bad identity, I couldn't help but smile. It's just too ridiculous!\n\nAs the Seer, I'm addressing the Witch in the later speaking positions. I request that you poison Player 6 tonight. From your perspective, this might seem like a demanding request. Considering the best interests of the good team, I suggest you either use your poison on a player in a later position or save it. Let me have another round to confront the little werewolf, Player 6. Of course, if you can decisively poison Player 6, it would prove your exceptional ability, but I dare not demand so much from the Witch. By tomorrow, I believe that with my positive, cheerful, and righteous speech, I will surely be able to vote out the werewolf.\n\nPlayer 9's speech was ordinary, lacking a central idea. I believe they are either a villager or a lower-ranked role. Player 1 said that even if we vote incorrectly, it's not a big deal. I understand this reasoning but don't agree with it. Voting out a special role on the first day, even if it takes out a werewolf, is definitely disadvantageous for the good team. It might not be a significant loss, but it's still a small one.\n\nPlayer 8 mentioned the possibility of werewolves declaring their teammates as bad identities. I want to say that your game skills are excellent, Player 8. You weren't deceived by Player 6's tactics and even considered the possibility of werewolves lynching their fellow werewolves. This proves that you're a player with independent thinking abilities and comprehensive logical coverage. Well done! Today, as the Seer, I will assist you, Player 8, the Hunter, in voting out Player 7, the werewolf who has been declared as a bad identity twice.\n\nTonight, I will use my unique Seer ability to check a player based on the speeches. So far, I haven't found anyone I particularly want to verify.",

Player 2 believes that Player 6's suggestion that the hunter in the later position doesn't need to reveal is not good, but I actually want to side with Player 6 because of this statement and reasoning. Since Player 6 gave Player 7 a bad identity, before Player 7 spoke, Player 6 didn't know what role Player 7, as a werewolf, would pretend to be to attack Player 6. Therefore, Player 6 analyzed all possible roles Player 7 might claim and provided counter-strategies. This is the kind of overall consideration and prediction of the werewolf team that I believe a seer should have. We know that Players 7 and 8 both claim to be the hunter, so one of them must be a werewolf and the other the real hunter. Player 2 thinks Players 6 and 7 are werewolves lynching each other, but I believe it's also possible that Players 2 and 7 are werewolves lynching each other. If Players 2 and 7 are both werewolves, then Player 2's actions benefit the werewolf team by voting for Player 7, their werewolf teammate, and framing Player 6 as the seer. Even if Player 7 is eliminated, it would still be difficult to determine whether Player 2 or Player 6 is the real seer, but Player 7 would definitely be a werewolf, and Player 8 would be the real hunter. This round, I choose to vote for Player 7.",

This means Player 8, who claimed to be the seer against Player 7, is actually the hunter. As for Players 2 and 6 both claiming to be the seer, I'm inclined to believe Player 6 is the real seer. The reason is that if a werewolf were to pretend to be a seer, they wouldn't need to identify their own teammate as a werewolf, especially in a later speaking position. This would put their fellow werewolf in the spotlight, which is not beneficial for the werewolf team's concealment. Moreover, if Player 6 were a werewolf, blindly identifying a later-speaking werewolf teammate as bad without knowing the real seer's verification would be very risky. If both the real seer and Player 6 identified Player 7 as bad, Player 7 would definitely be eliminated. On the other hand, if Player 2, who claimed to be the seer in a later position, were a werewolf, they would already know that Player 7 is their werewolf teammate and has been identified by the real seer. In this case, Player 2 could also identify Player 7 as bad and vote for them, thereby enhancing their own credibility as the seer. Therefore, I believe Player 6 is the real seer and Player 2 is a werewolf. Today, I will definitely vote for Player 7, and I hope the witch will use her poison to eliminate Player 2 during the night!",

Firstly, since the werewolf identified by the seer has already claimed to be the hunter, from the perspective of players without night actions, if I were a werewolf, not only am I not trying to save my werewolf teammate, but I'm also accelerating their elimination by identifying them as a werewolf. This is completely incomprehensible from the good team's perspective, so it's likely to gain their trust. My goal is to vote for my teammate (player 7), discredit the real seer, and persuade the witch to poison player 6 at night. Additionally, if we eliminate another powerful role at night, the werewolves will have the upper hand.\n\nDisadvantages: Firstly, we'll lose a werewolf teammate. Moreover, if I fail to gain the witch's trust and end up being poisoned by the witch after voting for player 7, the werewolf team will be in a dire situation.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n\nVote for player 7: Player 7 has been identified as a werewolf by both seers, so I must vote for them.\n\nIn conclusion, if player 7 is voted out, it will be more beneficial for the werewolf team.

However, when two players claim to be the Hunter, the first day becomes about eliminating one of these two Hunters. This is because the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, while the Seer cannot self-verify. The good team will likely vote among the Hunters. Therefore, to mimic the behavior of the good team, I should prioritize resolving the true and false Hunter issue on the first day, allowing the Seer and my fellow werewolf pretending to be a Seer to survive another round.\n\nCurrently, players 7 and 8 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\nPros and Cons Analysis:\n\n- **Player 7**: Since player 7, my werewolf teammate, has been identified as a werewolf by both player 6 (the real Seer) and player 2 (the werewolf pretending to be a Seer), player 7 must appear as a werewolf to the good players in later positions. To mimic the behavior of good players, I am forced to vote for my werewolf teammate, player 7, this round.\n\n- **Player 8**: Player 8 is competing with my werewolf teammate (player 7) for the Hunter role. Since player 7 definitely appears as a werewolf to the good players in later positions, if I rashly vote for player 8 (the Hunter), it would be equivalent to telling the good players in later positions that I am a werewolf. Voting for player 8 would be like walking into a trap, so I cannot vote for player 8 (the Hunter) this round.\n\nIn conclusion, to conceal my werewolf identity, I can only vote for player 7 this round.",
