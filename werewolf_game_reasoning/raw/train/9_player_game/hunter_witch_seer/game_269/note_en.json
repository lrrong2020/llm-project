My analysis: If Player 3 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, there's likely a real Hunter among the later speakers.

I believe Player 7 is a Villager who is seriously analyzing the situation.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a Villager, doesn't take sides, believes Player 3 is the Hunter, thinks Player 4 is a Villager.
