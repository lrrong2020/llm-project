Player 5's suggestion for me to claim to be the Seer is clearly an attempt to frame me, a non-action villager. No one has challenged Player 8's claim as the Seer, so 8 must be the only true Seer in the game. Player 8 confirmed Player 4 as a good identity, so 4 is definitely innocent. Player 4 claims to be the Witch and says they saved Player 9. Player 9's speech was reasonable, so I believe 9 could be a villager seriously analyzing the situation, though we can't rule out the possibility that 9 is a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive us. Player 1 claims to be the Hunter, and no one has challenged this claim, so I tentatively believe 1 is the true Hunter. The werewolves must be among Players 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 who claim to be villagers. Currently, Player 5 has given the worst speech, so I suggest we vote to eliminate Player 5, who seems to be a werewolf playing dumb. I recommend the Seer check Player 7's identity tonight to narrow down the werewolf suspects. The Witch should consider using their poison on either Player 2 or 3, whoever you think is more likely to be a werewolf.",

If there's no useful information, I plan to vote out No.2 today, mainly for the following reasons: First, I believe No.7 is innocent because I don't have the healing potion left, so there's no need for werewolves to kill one of their own to fake an identity. Second, yesterday No.7 voted for No.2, indicating that No.7 didn't trust No.2's identity. However, I'll still consider No.2's speech before making a final decision. In my opinion, the werewolf suspects are No.5 and No.6, with the last werewolf being either No.2 or No.9.",
