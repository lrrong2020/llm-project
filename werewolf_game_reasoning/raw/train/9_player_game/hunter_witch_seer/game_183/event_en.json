Last night, players 7 and 8 both died, but player 7, who was the Hunter, shot player 9. Player 9's identity is unknown; they could be either a villager or a werewolf. Player 8, who was poisoned, can only be a villager or a werewolf. The Witch still has the antidote; I suggest the Witch keep a low profile. If one of players 8 or 9 was a werewolf and has been eliminated, the villagers still have a chance. However, if both 8 and 9 were villagers, the good team has no chance of winning. I strongly condemn the Witch's decision not to save anyone and instead poison another player. I urge all villagers to vote for player 2 to be eliminated today.",

We've formed a voting bloc, and now you good guys need to dance to our tune, got it? What's there to discuss with you good guys? Nothing at all. It's no longer the time when you good guys had strength in numbers. The situation has changed, the tables have turned, and we werewolves are now singing our victory song. I'll give you good guys two choices. First: vote with us to eliminate villager number 5, ending things quickly for you and sparing yourselves some suffering. Second: split the vote with us for a tiebreaker, and we'll kill one of you during the night.",
