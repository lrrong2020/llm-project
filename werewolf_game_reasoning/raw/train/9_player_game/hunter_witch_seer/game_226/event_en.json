Player 6, speaking first, displayed a confident and fearless attitude, immediately revealing their identity, which strongly suggests they're the Hunter. Player 8 claimed to be a villager and expressed trust in Player 6; I classify them as a villager or higher. Player 9 pointed out that Player 8's thinking was subjective, which I find quite reasonable, so I consider Player 9 to be good. Player 1's speech was standard without any distinguishing features, making it difficult for me to define their identity. This concludes my assessment of all the players who have spoken so far, fully revealing my perspective. Today, I'm voting for Player 5.",

The thought process behind checking Player 7 is a long story, but to summarize, it was following the \"will of 7\"! As for what the \"will of 7\" specifically refers to, I won't elaborate here - you can look it up yourselves! Unfortunately, I've become the \"coroner\" in this game. I believe my good identity Player 7 was most likely the Witch killed by the werewolves, who, upon seeing herself stabbed, poisoned Player 2! Player 3 in the front position pretended to be a seer and declared Player 5 as having a bad identity. Given that there are only two players after Player 3, I think it's highly probable that Player 3, as a werewolf, gave Player 5 a bad identity in an attempt to challenge the real Seer in the later positions. Therefore, Player 5 is likely a good person! Player 6 in the first position claimed to be the Hunter. I believe that if Player 6 were a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, there would be no benefit in a situation where no werewolves are contesting the role. Thus, I think Player 6 might be the real Hunter. However, Player 6 as the Hunter didn't consider that Players 2 and 7 might be the eliminated Witch. Claiming to be the Hunter this round is tantamount to pushing the good team into the abyss. From this perspective, I think Player 6 lacks the thought process of a good person. Therefore, I can't definitively say Player 6 is the Hunter; they could also be a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter to draw out the real one! If there's a Hunter in the later positions, please hide your identity. Today, I ask everyone to follow me in voting out Player 3, the werewolf. Tonight, I will verify the identity of one player among Players 1, 8, and 9. I firmly believe that as long as we good people stand united, we can see a bright future!",

Last night, No. 1 was attacked. I was afraid No. 1 might be a werewolf intentionally self-attacking, so I didn't save them. To my surprise, No. 1 was the real Hunter. My action has led to the werewolves forming a binding vote, and this is my fault! No. 4 is pretending to be a seer, and No. 3 was the real Seer who was voted out. The logic is simple: if you, No. 4, were the Seer, why didn't the werewolves attack you last night? Would the werewolves be foolish enough to leave the Seer alive, allowing them to report their verification information and compress the werewolves' survival space? No. 6 was a villager who took the bullet for the real Hunter but sided with the wrong team yesterday, resulting in being shot by Hunter No. 1. The werewolf slots are No. 4 and No. 5, and No. 9 is a villager who sided with the wrong team. The werewolves have already formed a binding vote! To No. 9, although the situation looks grim for the good team, we shouldn't be discouraged. Today, please join me in voting out No. 4, who is pretending to be the Seer!",

Based on this, let's analyze the situation.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n\n- **Vote for Player 8**: Since Player 4, the Seer, identified Player 8 as having a bad identity, Player 8 must be the last werewolf. Player 8 claimed to be the Witch this round. From a werewolf's perspective, given that no Witch revealed themselves in the previous round, it's unlikely that the werewolves would choose to kill one of their own during the night. Therefore, Player 8's analysis that \"Player 1 is a werewolf who intentionally killed themselves\" doesn't hold up. Player 8 can only be a werewolf making a final attempt to survive.\n\nIn conclusion, I've decided to vote for Player 8.",

This means Player 4, who is competing with Player 3 for the Seer role, is the real Seer.
