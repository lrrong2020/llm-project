In comparison, player 2 says that 8's speech was smooth and natural. I want to point out that as the first speaker, with ample preparation time, would player 8 really stutter and hesitate in their speech? Player 1 didn't even give a reason for supporting 8, yet you, player 2, dare to guarantee that 1 is a good person. This means you, player 2, can only be the Witch.

If Player 3 were a werewolf, they wouldn't easily give a good identity to a villager when their werewolf teammate, Player 5, has been identified as a bad identity. This would limit the survival space for their werewolf team. Therefore, I think Player 3 is the Seer. Player 5, being identified as a bad identity by Player 8, is likely a villager. Player 8 is the werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Last night, Players 4 and 7 died. I believe one of them was the Witch who was killed by werewolves and used the poison on the other player. Player 9 claims to be the Hunter, and no one has challenged this claim, so Player 9's identity as the real Hunter is established. Knowing that I am a villager, I believe Player 1 is a werewolf. Player 1 has no reason to directly assume Player 8 is the Seer, so Player 1 is likely a werewolf supporting their teammate. The Seer, Player 3, can verify Player 1's identity tonight. Today, I will vote to eliminate Player 8, who I believe is a werewolf.",
