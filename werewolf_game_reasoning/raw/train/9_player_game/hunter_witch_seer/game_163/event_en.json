Number 4's comments on number 3 are fair, but the speech is too vague, I can't define number 4's identity. Number 6 analyzed a lot about what roles I, number 7, might claim, are you that insecure? Your entire speech was about analyzing the actions of who you consider to be definitely a werewolf, your perspective is distorted, isn't it? You don't dare to analyze any logic or potential werewolf positions on the field! With such an insecure speech, how can you claim to be the seer? Today, I, the hunter, will lead the vote.

I believe Player 6 is more likely to be the real seer.\n- **Player 1**: Did not explain the thought process behind checking Player 9 and gave a brief speech. Player 1's statement \"I think Player 7 is the real hunter\" reveals a flaw: If Player 1 were the seer and Player 9 were a bad identity, then Player 7, who is competing with Player 9 for the hunter role, must be the real hunter.

The speaking order is 6, then 1.\n- **Player 6**: Early position player pretends to be a seer and declares player 7 as bad identity.\n- **Player 1**: Later position player pretends to be a seer and declares player 9 as bad identity. This round, player 9 claims to be a hunter before player 1. If player 1 were the real seer and player 9 was their bad identity, player 1 wouldn't think player 9 could shoot. However, player 1 mentioned in their speech that player 9 might shoot, indicating a logical error in player 1's speech. Player 1 doesn't have the perspective of a seer.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Judgments of Other Players Based on the Seer's Assessment:\n- **Player 1**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 6.\n- **Player 7**: Is a werewolf identified as bad identity by player 6, the seer.\nBased on these conclusions, I decide to vote for player 7.",
