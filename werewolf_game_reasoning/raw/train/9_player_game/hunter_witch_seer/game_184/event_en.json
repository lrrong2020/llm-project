Player 1 believes that Players 5 and 9 are villagers, and Player 7 is the real Hunter. Therefore, Player 1 thinks there must be many werewolves among the later speakers. Player 1 has made a common werewolf mistake - a logical gap. Firstly, Player 1 only objectively stated the fact that Players 5 and 9 claimed to be villagers, but didn't directly acknowledge their identities. Even if they were acknowledged as villagers, there's no reason for it. Secondly, assuming Players 5 and 9 are indeed villagers and Player 7 is the Hunter, Player 1, from a good person's perspective, couldn't conclude that there must be many werewolves among the later speakers. It's possible that Players 2, 3, and 4 are the three werewolves, as Players 6 or 8 could also be werewolves. Clearly, Player 1 has a severe lack of perspective. Lastly, assuming Players 2, 3, and 4 are the three werewolves, logically, all later speakers would be werewolves. So how could Player 1 conclude that either Player 6 or 8 must be the Seer, given that the Seer hasn't claimed their role yet and no one in the earlier positions has claimed to be the Seer? Therefore, Player 1's speech lacks logical support and is based purely on imagination. I don't believe a good person could make such statements, so I think Players 1 and 3 are two werewolves. We should vote for Player 3 today and Player 1 tomorrow.",

Number 7 claims to be the hunter, and no one else has claimed this role, so I tentatively believe Number 7 is the real hunter. Number 9's speech was rather vague, so I can't define their role yet. Number 1 directly assumed Numbers 5 and 9 are villagers, believed there are more werewolves in the later positions, and thought Numbers 2, 3, and 4 are the three werewolves. Knowing my own identity as a good person, I believe Number 1 is a werewolf pretending to be a villager, trying to limit the good team's survival space. Number 1 could identify Numbers 5 and 9 without any reason, so I think Number 1 is a werewolf with inside information. Number 2's speech also pointed out Number 1's mistakes, so I believe Numbers 1 and 2 are not on the same team, and I think Number 2 is the real seer. As for Number 3, they must be a werewolf who didn't immediately pretend to be a seer, trying to make the good team believe the seer died during the night to gain credibility. I'm voting to eliminate Number 3 today.",

First, there are only two players after 2, so how could 3 immediately pretend to be a seer after being identified as a bad identity? Second, if 3 doesn't claim to be a seer, 2 would be the only seer in the game, which gives 3's strategy no credibility. Therefore, I believe 2 and 4 are werewolves, while 3 is a villager. As the hunter, I must carry the hope for the good team. This round, I'll lead the vote to eliminate 2, who I believe is pretending to be a seer.",

Player 1 has now admitted to being a werewolf, but we good players can't give up. Perhaps player 1 is just bluffing and pretending to be relaxed? So, player 1, you werewolf, please vote for yourself as well. During yesterday's speech phase, the only player I could tell was good was player 4. I don't understand why player 3, after being identified as a werewolf, didn't immediately pretend to be the Seer to counter me. I don't understand why the Witch wouldn't save herself on the first night when she could, and instead poisoned an outer position player. So, as player 1 said, player 9 must be the real Witch, who didn't save anyone and blindly poisoned without any information, showing no responsibility for her role or concern for the good team's chances of winning. Well, it seems that only I, the Seer, and player 4, the good player, are taking this game seriously on the good team's side! I vote for player 1.",
