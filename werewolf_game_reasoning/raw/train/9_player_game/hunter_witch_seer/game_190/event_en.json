The Seer can check whoever they want, so how can player 7 consider \"the Seer can check whoever they want\" as a typical werewolf statement?

Player 9 forcefully attacked Player 7, and stood up to say \"I'm not the Seer either,\" which I believe is a statement unique to werewolves.

Last night, Players 6 and 8 were eliminated, but Player 4 only mentioned Player 6. Player 4 said that because Player 6 is a good person, Players 5 and 7 might be werewolves. However, if we think carefully, following Player 4's logic, what if Player 8 was a werewolf who was eliminated? Wouldn't that mean Players 7 and 9 could possibly be good people? Player 4 completely failed to consider Player 8's identity, so Player 4 is fabricating reasons to attack Players 3, 5, and 7. Since Player 3 is verified as good by me, and I don't think Player 4 would dare to attack three good people simultaneously, I believe either Player 5 or 7 is likely Player 4's werewolf teammate. With both Players 6 and 8 dead, we're unsure if there was a werewolf among them. We need to observe the voting patterns of the remaining players this round to determine if there are two or three werewolves left. Player 1 claimed to be the Witch, which I won't analyze now. They might be the real Witch, but we'll need to see if Player 1 is eliminated tomorrow. Player 9's speech attacked Player 7, so Player 9 is likely not on the same side as Player 7. If Player 7 is a werewolf, then Player 9 is probably a good person. Therefore, I choose to verify Player 7 tonight. We need to further observe Player 5's voting and speech. This round, I ask all good people to join me in voting to eliminate Player 4, who is a werewolf!",
