Since the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their card, we can determine who the real Hunter is. For now, we can set aside the question of whether No. 5 or No. 3 is the real Seer and make a decision tomorrow after they share their verification information.\n\nAt this point, what I should do is:\n\n- **Vote for Player No. 7**: As I am the Hunter, yet No. 7 claims to be the Hunter. If No. 7 were a good player, they wouldn't rashly claim to be the Hunter, as this behavior would confuse the good team's perspective and affect their judgment. Therefore, No. 7 is likely a werewolf pretending to be me. I must vote for Player No. 7 who is impersonating me.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player No. 7.",
