Let me explain again: if I were a werewolf, I wouldn't risk exposing myself before the Seer has spoken up. Since No.3 has already claimed a role, if I were a werewolf, it would be more beneficial to secretly kill them at night, as they wouldn't know who to shoot. However, now that No.3, a werewolf, has pretended to be the Hunter, I risk being voted out if I don't speak up. Therefore, I must stand up to give all good players the correct perspective.

I believe one of them was the Witch who was forced to use the poison to prove their identity after being attacked, killing the other player. Player 9, pretending to be the Seer, claimed to have found a bad identity among the two remaining players in later positions, which has no credibility at all. Player 1 claimed to be a villager and strongly sided with player 9, the werewolf, without analyzing whether player 2 made any claims or considering the overall situation. I believe player 1 is likely a werewolf charging for player 9. If player 1 is indeed a werewolf, the probability of player 9 successfully pretending to be the Seer is 100%, which is completely unconvincing! Given that we already have two players, 3 and 7, claiming to be the Hunter, and I haven't found any bad identities, I suggest the good players vote between players 3 and 7. Even if we mistakenly vote out the real Hunter, they can still shoot to help us turn the tide! Between players 3 and 7, I'm inclined to believe that player 3 is a werewolf and player 7 is the Hunter. Although player 7 claimed to be the Hunter after player 3, player 7's careful analysis of the situation makes them more credible than player 3, who gave a lackluster speech when claiming to be the Hunter. Now we're at the \"I bet your gun has no bullets\" stage. Everyone should vote between players 3 and 7, but since I'm certain of my identity as the Seer, I will definitely vote for player 9, the werewolf pretending to be the Seer, as they are undoubtedly a werewolf from my perspective!",
