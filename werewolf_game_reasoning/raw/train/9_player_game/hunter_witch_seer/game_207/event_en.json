Shouldn't we condemn the witch then? Could it be that No. 4 is a werewolf, knowing who was targeted at night, aware that a good person was killed, and then came here to feign gratitude to the witch? No. 4 is a werewolf! No. 5 hopes the seer can be found by the good people? Well, let me ask, if the real seer's speech is poor, but the werewolf pretending to be a seer speaks perfectly, what should we do if the good people can't find the real seer? Should we just give up this game? I think you, No. 5, should engage with the seer and encourage them to speak well, to identify the obvious good people and the werewolves hidden among them. Only in this way, with good people working together, can we vote out the werewolves and win. It's not enough to simply say you hope the seer can be found by good people. I believe No. 5's speech is full of filler content and not at all sincere. No. 5 is a werewolf! I think both No. 4 and No. 5 before me are werewolves!

So, Player 6, are you the judge of this game? However, I find Player 6's subsequent speech to be very substantial, with depth, perspective, logic, output, and substance. They also agree with me that Player 5 is a werewolf, so I believe Player 6 is on the good side. If this is a game with cautious werewolves and the seer hasn't identified any bad identities, I suggest we vote for Player 5. At the same time, I hope that a werewolf in a later position who pretends to be a seer could declare me as a bad identity. This way, I wouldn't have to think too hard about finding the werewolves!",

The speeches from players 4 and 5 in earlier positions were rather vague, so I can't define their identities. Player 6 claims they're not a villager, not a werewolf, not the Seer, not the Witch, and not the Hunter, so I really can't figure out what role player 6 is. I think player 6 might be a good player intentionally confusing the werewolves' perspective, or they could be a werewolf giving an overly theatrical speech. I don't understand how player 7 can directly accept player 6 as good; I believe players 6 and 7 are likely unrelated, with player 7 possibly being a confused good player or a werewolf with inside information.

            "context": "Seer 9 checked player 6 last night and found them to be a werewolf. The reason for checking 6 is because I am 9, and when 9 is rotated 180°, it becomes 6, so I chose to check the number that looks most similar to 9. Player 6 attacked players 4 and 5, claiming both are werewolves. 6's reason for accusing 4 of being a werewolf is that 4 thanked the witch for using the potion, ensuring a peaceful night. 6's reason for accusing 5 of being a werewolf is that 5 hoped the seer could be found by the good team rather than letting the seer speak freely. I believe 6's attacks on 4 and 5 are based on forced false logic, because 6 is my bad identity. Therefore, I deduce that at least one of 4 and 5 is likely good, or both 4 and 5 are good, because if 4 and 5 were 6's werewolf teammates, 6 wouldn't need to make both of their werewolf teammates the focus of attention.\n\nPlayer 7's speech suggests that 6 is good, leading me to believe that 7's identity is less trustworthy than 6's. However, since I haven't checked 7, as the seer, I need to gather votes from everyone except the werewolves. So, I must be humble and not rashly accuse 7 of being a werewolf without clear verification. Although 7's reasoning for defining 5's identity seems hasty, 7 can still be checked once. In case 7 is good, I still want to bring 7 back to our side.\n\nPlayer 8 pretended to be a seer and accurately challenged the real seer 9, putting me at a natural disadvantage. I not only need to analyze the werewolf positions but also need to gain everyone's trust. From 8's perspective, only 9 is a werewolf, and 8 is solely focused on voting for me, without analyzing information about others or daring to define their roles. 8 doesn't even mention who to check tonight. If 8 thinks 6 is good, and 7 thinks 6 is good, then 7 is likely to be good. 6 attacked 4 and 5, so from 8's viewpoint, one of 4 and 5 might be a werewolf. If 8 thinks 6 is a werewolf, then 7 can be checked, and 4 and 5 might not be werewolves. 8 doesn't dare to analyze this logic, so how can 8 be the real seer?\n\nAs the real seer 9, I see 6 and 8 as definite werewolves. I vote for 6, the bad identity. Tonight, I plan to check 7. Since players 1, 2, and 3 haven't spoken yet, after hearing their updated speeches, if 7 is willing to side with me, I will decide who to check based on the updated speeches and votes.",

So, Player 8, how do you define the identities of Players 4 and 5? Also, Player 1, the werewolf, is pretending to be the witch and siding with Player 8. Therefore, I believe Player 8 is pretending to be the seer, and Player 1 is the charging werewolf. As for Player 9, their speech, both in logic and eloquence, is breathtaking. Their speech is smooth and natural, with precise wording and strong persuasiveness, completely convincing - the epitome of a legendary seer in my mind.

Yesterday, I noticed player 7 was the only one who voted for me, so I assumed 7 was a werewolf trying to vote me out as the Seer. I checked 7 last night, but it turns out 7 has a good identity. Currently, we know that 9 is pretending to be a Seer and is also my bad identity. Among players 1, 2, and 3, there are likely two werewolves. Today, let's first listen to what players 1, 2, and 3 have to say.

I chose to check No. 5 because in my perspective, No. 6 and No. 8 are both werewolves, while among No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, there's one villager, one werewolf, and one witch. I believe their situation can be resolved independently. The real witch will use the poison to eliminate the werewolf they suspect. I think among No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, there must be a villager protecting the witch. No. 3's speech yesterday was strange. They didn't choose sides but claimed No. 1 and No. 2 are both werewolves, and either No. 8 or No. 9 is a werewolf. From No. 3's perspective, if they sided with No. 8, it's understandable to think No. 1 and No. 2 are both werewolves, but No. 3 didn't attack No. 9. If No. 3 sided with No. 9, then No. 9's bad identity check on No. 6 and No. 8 (who claimed to be the seer against No. 9) would mean they are both werewolves, leaving only one werewolf between No. 1 and No. 2. So yesterday, I directly judged that No. 3 is a werewolf trying to support No. 8 without daring to attack No. 9, which means one of No. 1 and No. 2 is the witch and the other is a villager. Although No. 1 said they sided with No. 8 during their speech yesterday, they ended up voting for No. 6 (my bad identity check) along with No. 2. Therefore, I deduce that No. 1 is likely the villager, and No. 2 is probably the real witch. Since I've identified No. 3, No. 6, and No. 8 as the three werewolves, I directly checked No. 5, who voted for No. 3, in the later position. As expected, No. 5 is a good identity. Unfortunately, the werewolves killed No. 5 last night, which proves No. 3 is not the witch, otherwise it would have been a double death of No. 3 and No. 5. The werewolf team wanted to kill No. 5, who voted for No. 3 in the later position, so that after No. 3 is poisoned today, it could confuse everyone into thinking No. 3 poisoned No. 5. As the seer, I declare that No. 3 and No. 8 are the last two surviving werewolves. I vote for No. 3 and No. 8, and request No. 2, the witch, to vote for one of them.",

If I'm attacked, it will prove I'm the true witch, and the werewolf pretending to be the witch today will surely be eliminated! After careful consideration, I chose not to use my poison last night. The reason is: Yesterday, both No. 1 and No. 2 claimed to be the witch, and I instinctively thought they were both werewolves. However, if they were both werewolves, we also have No. 8 and No. 9 both claiming to be the seer. In this case, either No. 8 or No. 9 must be a werewolf: No. 9 gave a bad identity to No. 6, and if No. 6 were also a werewolf, there would be too many werewolves. So No. 6 must be a confirmed villager, No. 9 must be the werewolf, and No. 8 must be the real seer. But yesterday, looking at the voting pattern, No. 4 voted for No. 6, No. 7 voted for No. 8, and No. 5 voted for me. The three players I believed to be good - No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 - didn't unanimously vote for No. 9. So I pondered if perhaps one of No. 1 or No. 2 was actually a villager trying to protect the witch, rather than both being werewolves pretending to be the witch. If I hastily used my poison, I might have poisoned a good player. After much deliberation, I decided to hold onto my poison. Today, both No. 1 and No. 2 have dropped their witch claims. I'm not sure which of them is the villager and which is the werewolf, so let's focus on voting between No. 8 and No. 9 who both claim to be the seer! At least one of them must be a werewolf. I ask the players who haven't spoken yet to help consolidate the votes!",
