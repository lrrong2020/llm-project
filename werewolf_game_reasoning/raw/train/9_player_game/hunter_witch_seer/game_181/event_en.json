Last night, the despicable werewolves took advantage of the dark and windy night to kill our beloved Hunter, Player 1. Player 1 shot and eliminated Player 9, whose identity I currently don't know, but I hope it was another werewolf! Regarding the bad identity of Player 8, if I were you, I would immediately pretend to be a Seer right now, to avoid exposing your werewolf teammates! I urge the Witch to conceal their identity well. This game will rely on our two special roles working together to lead the good team to victory! This round, I hope all good players can unite wholeheartedly and resolutely expel Player 8, the werewolf, from our beautiful village!",

My strategy for checking player 9 was to start with those close to me, as finding a good identity could help me gather votes, while identifying a werewolf would allow me to eliminate them immediately. First, I must commend player 1, the Hunter - you're truly a sharpshooter, taking out a werewolf with a single bullet! Player 3's reasoning is entirely false logic, saying things like \"three-eight, three-eight, one must be a kill.\" This kind of speech is clearly based on the daytime speaking order, attempting to pretend to be the Seer and falsely accuse player 8 as a werewolf! Unfortunately, I've been targeted by the despicable werewolves, but I am the real Seer. Player 4's speech didn't take sides, so I believe player 4 is likely a villager. Player 5's speech was upright and impartial, and not aligned with player 3, so I think player 5 is good. Player 6 claims to be the Witch, and I tentatively believe you are the real Witch. If player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, the real Witch can poison them tonight. I'm calling for votes against player 3, who I believe is pretending to be the Seer. I think the werewolves are players 3 and 9!",

Player 3 declares player 8 as a bad identity, while player 8 declares the eliminated player 9 as a bad identity. Although player 8 pretended to be a seer immediately after being accused by player 3, if player 8 were a werewolf, declaring the eliminated player 9 as a bad identity wouldn't be very beneficial, as player 9 can no longer speak. Player 4 claims to be a villager, which I temporarily believe. Player 1 is the eliminated hunter, player 6 claims to be the witch, and player 7 claims to be a villager. This means player 5 can only be a villager or a werewolf, but since I, player 2, am a villager, I believe player 5 is likely a werewolf.\n\nPlayer 5 thinks player 3 is pretending to be the seer and believes player 4 is not on the same team as player 3, so player 4 is good. This indicates player 5's identity is lower than player 4's. Moreover, I judge that player 4 is likely a real villager, and player 7 claims to be a villager. I'm also a villager, and there are only 3 villagers in total, so player 5 can only be a werewolf. Based on this, we can deduce that players 5 and 3 are not on the same team, and players 7 and 3 are not on the same team.\n\nIf we consider player 8 as pretending to be the seer, then player 3 is the real seer, and players 5 and 7 are player 8's werewolf teammates. If we consider player 3 as pretending to be the seer, then player 8 is the seer, players 3 and 9 are werewolves, and player 4 would have to be a werewolf. However, player 5 believes player 4 is good, so before considering player 4 as a werewolf, we should first consider player 5 as a werewolf. Therefore, I believe that regardless of whether player 3 or 8 is the seer, player 5 is in my definite werewolf category.\n\nI think players 7 and 9 could be either villagers or werewolves, and players 3 and 8 could be either the seer or werewolves. However, in my view, player 5 is definitely a werewolf. This round, I will most likely vote for player 5.",

If 8 were a werewolf, giving a bad identity to the unknown player 9 would offer no benefit.

This makes me suspect that Number 5 has the perspective of a Werewolf who knows Number 4 is good, implying Number 5's identity is lower than Number 4's.\n- If we assume Number 8 is pretending to be the Seer and Number 3 is the real Seer, then Numbers 5 and 7 are Number 8's Werewolf teammates.\n- If we assume Number 3 is pretending to be the Seer and Number 8 is the real Seer, then Numbers 3 and 9 (identified as bad by Number 8) are the Werewolf pair. Number 4 could potentially be Number 3's Werewolf teammate, but since Number 5's identity is lower than Number 4's, the Werewolf positions are likely 3, 5, and 9.\n- Based on this analysis, regardless of whether Number 3 or 8 is the real Seer, Number 5 must be a Werewolf.\n\nWerewolf possibility ranking:\n- Number 5 > Number 3 = Number 8\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Number 5.",

Today, I only want to persuade No. 2 Villager to reconsider. No. 5 attacked No. 3 Werewolf in their speech and also attacked No. 4. Although No. 5 currently believes No. 4 is a Villager, it's just a temporary judgment. If No. 5 were No. 3's werewolf teammate, they would vote for me without hesitation. But from the voting pattern, we can see that No. 5 can't be a werewolf; No. 5 can only be a good person. No. 4's speech didn't explicitly support No. 3, but the voting pattern doesn't lie. No. 4 is the werewolf who gives vague speeches but votes alongside No. 3 to attack. I can definitively say today that the werewolf positions are No. 3, No. 4, and No. 9, with no other possibilities! Addressing No. 6 Witch, I apologize for questioning your identity in the previous round. It was because the werewolves didn't choose to attack, and I was trying to find the last remaining werewolf. I implore No. 2 Villager and No. 6 Witch to vote for No. 3 Werewolf! As No. 3 Werewolf said, if I'm voted out by the werewolves and the good people who don't trust me, and then the werewolves kill No. 6 at night, we good people will lose. If I survive this round of voting, I will unhesitatingly check No. 4's identity tonight. As the Seer, my duty is to use my ability to lead the good people in finding the werewolves and expelling them. Please trust me, good people, and vote for No. 3 Werewolf today.",

This gives player 3's verification considerable weight, making it possible that they are the real Seer.\n\n- **Player 8**: After being claimed as a bad identity by player 3, they immediately pretended to be a Seer, but then claimed player 9 (who is already out) as a bad identity. If player 8 were a werewolf, claiming player 9 as a bad identity would offer no benefit. Therefore, player 8 might have genuinely verified player 9, suggesting they could also be the real Seer.\n\nAs a good player in this game, I currently lack sufficient ability to discern the situation on the field. Regarding players 3 and 8, who are both claiming to be the Seer, I cannot determine who the real Seer is at this time.

Therefore, I believe Player 8 has a limited perspective and is too eager to eliminate others, which doesn't match my expectations for a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose to vote for Player 8.",

Player 2 didn't vote for either of the claimed Seers, but instead voted for a player in a later position based on their own analysis, so player 2 is likely a good role. Player 7 (me) who voted for player 3 is a villager, and player 6 who voted for player 8 is the Witch. Excluding players 6 and 7, we're left with players 5 and 8 on one side, and players 3 and 4 on the other side. Therefore, it can only be that players 5 and 8 are both werewolves, or players 3 and 4 are both werewolves. This means player 9 must be the werewolf taken out by the Hunter. Player 8's logic in declaring player 9 as bad identity makes sense, so I believe player 8 is the real Seer, and player 3 is pretending to be a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 3.",
