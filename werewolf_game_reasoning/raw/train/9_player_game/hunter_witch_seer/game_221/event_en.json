Therefore, we good players must not split our votes and should vote together for Player 4, the werewolf. I don't need to elaborate on Player 8's suspicious points, right? How could the double death of Players 1 and 7 prove that the Witch is still in the game? Is it possible that Player 6 is the Witch? Player 8's perspective completely ignores Player 6! I suspect Player 6 might be Player 8's werewolf teammate, which is why Player 8 chose not to mention Player 6. Players 6, 8, and 4 are the three werewolves I've identified. Player 9 received a good identity from Player 8 but didn't immediately side with them, which is good. I believe Player 9 is likely a good player. I'm addressing Player 9 - if you vote with me, we good players will win! To Players 3 and 5, I haven't heard your statements yet, but I'm assuming you're both good players for now.

Player 8's effort to declare good identities for the later positions is significant, as there aren't many players in the later positions this round. Player 9 seemed confused after being declared as a good identity, and I don't understand why player 9 is not confirming their stance. However, if we believe that player 2 is the seer, then the possibility of players 4, 8, and 9 all being werewolves is clearly not valid, because that would result in a tied vote, making it impossible to vote out a villager. But players 8 and 9 haven't admitted to being werewolves or tried to form a voting bloc; instead, they're giving serious speeches. This leaves only two possibilities: First, player 2 is not the seer but a werewolf pretending to be one. Second, I misjudged player 9's identity, and players 4 and 8 are the werewolves. Regardless of which possibility is true, I need to hear the speeches from players 4 and 5 before making a decision. For this round, my understanding of the earlier positions is that player 2 is either a werewolf or the seer, player 8 is either a werewolf or the seer, player 9 is either a villager or a werewolf, players 8 and 9 cannot both be werewolves, and player 7 is the hunter.

My speech will move all the good people, while yours will only provoke public anger! Addressing all good people, if Number 2 were a real seer, they wouldn't think Number 9 is likely good! Because Number 9 is Number 8's good identity, Number 8 dares to give a good identity to Number 9 in a later position without fearing Number 9 might turn against them and claim to be the seer, so Numbers 8 and 9 are likely on the same side. If Number 2 were a real seer, they would definitely accuse Numbers 8 and 9 of being two werewolves! But Number 2 thinks Number 9 is likely good. I analyze that Number 2, pretending to be the seer, is trying to win Number 9's favor, wanting Number 9's vote as a good person!

As player 4 analyzed, if 2 were the real Seer, they wouldn't have said that 9 is likely a good person! Since 9 is player 8's good identity, 8 dared to give a good identity to 9, who is in a later speaking position, without fearing that 9 would turn against them and claim to be the Seer. This suggests that 8 and 9 are likely on the same side. I find this reasoning very convincing. Moreover, if 9 were a werewolf, and 4, 8, and 9 were all werewolves, they would already have enough votes to control the game. There would be no need for them to go through all this trouble with us good people, so this logic clearly doesn't hold up. This round, I will follow Seer 8's lead and vote to eliminate player 2, the werewolf!",

The speaking order is 8, then 2.\n- **Player 2**: Declares player 4 as bad identity, believes the werewolf pool consists of players 6, 8, and 4. Player 2's speech considers player 9 as good, which is highly illogical for a seer. Werewolves pretending to be seers typically declare later-position players as good identities. If such a claim were made about an actual seer, it would lead to immediate elimination. If player 8 were pretending to be a seer, a normal perspective would reasonably suspect player 9 as likely 8's werewolf teammate. Therefore, player 2's perspective doesn't seem like a seer's, but rather a werewolf who knows player 9's good identity.\n- **Player 8**: Declares player 9 as good identity with strong conviction. If player 8 were pretending to be a seer, recklessly declaring a later-position player as good identity could easily target the real seer, risking exposure. It would be safer to declare a bad identity instead. Thus, player 8 seems more likely to be the true seer who genuinely verified player 9.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 8 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity assessments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf competing with player 8 for the seer role.\n- **Player 9**: Player 8's confirmed good identity.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 2 > 8 > 9\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 2.",

No. 3 has already analyzed the inconsistencies in No. 2's claim of being the Seer, with the werewolf pool being No. 4, No. 8, and No. 9. However, in his speech, he still chose not to side with No. 8, the Seer, yet in the voting phase, he followed No. 8's lead and voted for No. 2. I suspect No. 3 is a werewolf who didn't want to side with No. 8, the real Seer, in his speech, but also didn't dare to charge forward for his werewolf teammate No. 2, who hasn't gained the trust of the good team. He's trying to struggle a bit by abandoning his werewolf teammate in the voting phase and siding with No. 8, the real Seer, by voting for No. 2, his own werewolf teammate. I hope No. 8, the Seer, has checked No. 3's identity. This round, I will most likely vote for No. 3, unless No. 8, the Seer, has identified other werewolves.",

Let's analyze based on this.\n\nLogical analysis:\n- Since Players 3 and 9 both claim to be the Witch, and we know Player 9 is confirmed as good by Player 8, Player 9 must be the real Witch.\n- If Player 9 were a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, we'd have to first assume that Player 8, who confirmed Player 9 as good, is also a werewolf. If both Players 8 and 9 were werewolves, then Player 2 would be the real Seer who identified Player 4 as a werewolf. In that case, there would have been three werewolves present yesterday, and they could have already formed a majority vote.\n- With Players 9 and 3 both claiming to be the Witch, from Player 3's perspective as the Witch, Player 9 must be a werewolf. Additionally, since Player 8 confirmed Player 9 as good in the previous round, both Players 8 and 9 should be considered werewolves, even though Player 8 saved Player 3. However, Player 3 still insists that Players 8 and 9 are both good, without reconsidering the possibility that Player 2 might be the real Seer. This logic doesn't align with what a good player would typically think.\n- Moreover, as we analyzed earlier, if Players 4, 8, and 9 were all werewolves present yesterday, not forming a majority vote would go against the werewolves' principle of maximizing their advantage.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n- Vote for Player 3: Player 8 is the real Seer and has identified Player 3 as a werewolf today. I should follow the Seer's lead and vote to eliminate their bad identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 3.",
