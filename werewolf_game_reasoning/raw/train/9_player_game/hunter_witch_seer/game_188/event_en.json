I thought my position at number 9 would be awkward, but God granted me the privilege of speaking first, allowing me to step up and lead the good team. This undoubtedly weakens the impact of any later players pretending to be the Seer! Last night, players 4 and 6 both died. I believe one of them was the Witch who was forced to use the poison after being attacked, killing the other player. The Witch wouldn't recklessly poison someone without saving anyone; they must have been compelled to use the poison after being attacked themselves. I'm very glad to have identified a werewolf, as this at least allows us to regain some ground and avoid a total loss! Tonight, I will verify the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on their speech and voting behavior. If player 7 claims to be the Seer, it's equivalent to admitting they're a werewolf. I hope the werewolf pretending to be the Seer in a later position will stand up and try to save their teammate, player 7. This way, both werewolves will be exposed, and I can directly verify the last werewolf tonight! Today, please join me in voting out player 7, the werewolf.",

I think 9's accusation of player 7 as a werewolf is quite convincing, especially since no one has challenged 9's seer claim up to my turn. In my opinion, 7 is likely to counter-claim as the seer immediately. I'm skeptical about player 1's hunter identity. Given that the witch is likely out between players 4 and 6, I think rashly claiming to be the hunter doesn't benefit the good team's victory. Therefore, I believe 1 could be either the real hunter or a werewolf trying to draw out the real hunter.

Most good players on the field are siding with Seer No. 9. Although werewolf teammate No. 6 has already been poisoned by the witch, if I follow Seer No. 9 and vote for werewolf teammate No. 7, I can elevate my status and better conceal my werewolf identity, potentially surviving longer in the game to create opportunities for the werewolf team.\n\n- Voting for player No. 8: The disadvantage is that werewolf teammate No. 7's immediate pretense to be a seer is weaker in credibility compared to the earlier-speaking Seer No. 9. Therefore, good players are not siding with werewolf teammate No. 7. If I rashly vote for villager No. 8, it could easily expose my werewolf identity, which is unfavorable for my survival and prevents me from creating opportunities for the werewolf team.\n\nIn conclusion, if werewolf teammate No. 7 is voted out, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf faction.

From last round's voting, I can't tell who among the remaining players is a werewolf, as all the remaining players voted for Werewolf No. 7. Yesterday, No. 1 claimed to be the Hunter, and no one voted for No. 1 during the voting, which indicates that No. 1 is indeed the real Hunter. I believe No. 3's speech yesterday, suggesting No. 1 to hide his Hunter identity, seems to be thinking on behalf of our good team, so I think No. 3 is more likely to be good. Therefore, I believe the werewolves are among No. 2 and No. 8. If both No. 2 and No. 8 are werewolves, we good people have certainly lost, because the Witch didn't save No. 9 who was killed last night, which means the Witch who died must be among No. 4 and No. 6 who were eliminated on the first day. So if there are still two werewolves alive, even if we lynch one werewolf this round, the remaining werewolf can kill the Hunter to win. We can only hope that the Witch has poisoned one werewolf for us to have a chance to win! After hearing everyone's speech this round, I will vote between No. 2 and No. 8.",

Since players 2, 3, and 5 have unknown identities and all voted for the werewolf number 7 in the previous round, I believe only one of them is a werewolf. Otherwise, the werewolves would have chosen to vote for the real seer, which would have been a better strategy with a chance to eliminate the true seer. Therefore, I think one of the players eliminated on the first day (4 or 6) was the witch, and the other was a werewolf. The current situation is that both the witch and seer (number 9) have been eliminated, leaving only player 1 as the hunter. Two werewolves have been eliminated, with the last one hiding among players 2, 3, and 5. Let's analyze the speeches of players 2, 3, and 5 to find the last werewolf. Since the werewolf pretending to be a seer (number 7) showed significant hostility towards player 3 in the previous round, and player 3 stated they would directly side with player 9, while also attacking player 1 (the hunter), if player 3 were a werewolf trying to mislead, they wouldn't attack the hunter while siding with the real seer, as it would draw attention from the hunter and other good players. Therefore, I believe player 3 is good. Player 5's speech was similar to player 3's, both siding with seer number 9 and attacking hunter number 1, so I think player 5 is also good. Player 2 didn't indicate which side they were on in the previous round, seemingly a weak werewolf card that doesn't want to side with the real seer but also doesn't dare to directly side with their werewolf teammate. Therefore, I will vote for player 2 this round.",

Player 1 claims to be the hunter, and I'm not the hunter, so I trust 1's hunter identity. I suspect either 3 or 8 is a werewolf because 3 immediately supported 9 on the first day without hearing any speeches, which seems like a werewolf knowing 9's good identity and 7's werewolf teammate identity, choosing to support 9 as a reverse strategy. Player 8's speech was brief after being declared as a bad identity by the werewolves in the previous round, but their speech this round is noticeably more forceful. If 8 is 7's werewolf teammate, 7's immediate claim of being the seer and declaring 8 as a bad identity would benefit the werewolf team by elevating 8's status, thus protecting them from being voted out, and 8 has stated they will vote for 2 this round.

Player 8, who is pretending to be a seer, gave a bad identity check today and analyzed a lot of information, presenting their own logic. In contrast, Player 2 attacked me, Player 3, claiming I sided with Player 9 without listening to their speech. But didn't I listen to Player 9's speech yesterday?

In this round, despite suspecting No.8 to be a high-status werewolf, they still made an ambiguous statement about \"voting between No.3 and No.8\".

Thinks if both 2 and 8 were werewolves, the villagers would have already lost. This shows typical villager reasoning.\n- **Player 8**: Suspects player 2 is a werewolf. Player 8 doesn't try to divert attention to all villagers, but focuses on analyzing and identifying player 2 as suspicious. This doesn't align with a werewolf's mentality of creating confusion and avoiding becoming the center of attention. Werewolves typically try to cast suspicion on all villagers to create chaos and avoid scrutiny.\n- **Player 2**: Provides the least analysis and attempts to direct suspicion between players 3 and 8, without committing to a vote. This behavior suggests a werewolf trying to split the villagers' votes. Moreover, player 2 had the least input in yesterday's discussion, resembling a werewolf trying to lay low.\n- **Player 3**: Vouches for player 8 as a villager. If player 3 were a werewolf, there would be no need to protect player 8, unless they were both werewolves. However, if that were the case, the werewolves would have already won. Therefore, we can only assume both players 3 and 8 are villagers.\n\n# Probability Ranking of Werewolves:\n- 2 > 3 = 5 = 8\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 2.",

Based on this, let's analyze the situation.\n\nAssuming Player 7 is pretending to be a Seer, here's my assessment of other players' identities:\n\n- **Player 8**: Player 8 was claimed as a bad identity by Player 7, who is pretending to be a Seer. If Players 7 and 8 were on the same team, either 7 or 8 would have been eliminated in the first round. There's no benefit for Player 7, as a werewolf, to claim their teammate as a bad identity after being identified as a werewolf by the real Seer (Player 9). Therefore, I believe Player 8 is likely a good player.\n\n- **Player 2**: This round, Player 8 accused Player 2 of being a werewolf early in the speaking order. However, Player 2, speaking later, accused both Players 3 and 8 of being werewolves. This doesn't align with the typical logic of a good player identifying their accuser as a werewolf. Thus, I believe Player 2 is likely a werewolf.\n\n- **Player 3**: In the previous round, Player 3 advised Player 1 (the Hunter) to conceal their identity. I agree with Player 3's perspective, so I think Player 3 is likely a good player.\n\nRanking the likelihood of being a werewolf:\n- 2 > 8 > 3\n\nIn conclusion, I've decided to vote for Player 2.",
