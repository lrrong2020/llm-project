Player 3 seems to think the first position is a golden opportunity to slack off, but I've never heard of a Seer who can slack off with a clear conscience! However, player 4, upon receiving a bad identity from player 3, immediately pretended to be a Seer and gave player 3 a bad identity in return. Player 4 also didn't present any logic that impressed me, although player 3's accusation of player 4 was quite strong. In conclusion, player 3 has the advantage of a strong verification, but their speech makes it hard for me to believe them. Player 4, while analyzing the identities of eliminated players, didn't analyze the werewolves' strategy or potential werewolf positions after receiving a bad identity from player 3, which is equally unconvincing.

I believe if Player 4 were a werewolf, there would be no need to counter-accuse Player 3 after being accused. Player 4 could have easily identified a player in a later position as a good identity to gain favor or as a bad identity to increase credibility. Moreover, Player 3's speech was too brief and didn't define any of the eliminated players. Therefore, I think Player 4 is more likely to be the real seer. Player 8 claimed to be a villager and indicated they might abstain from voting this round. I think Player 8 might be a villager without night actions who doesn't fully understand the situation. I'd like to address Player 8: We know that Player 7, the hunter, has been eliminated, and we can't define the roles of Players 5 and 6 yet. If good players abstain from voting, it might lead to the werewolves voting out the real seer. I trust my own judgment, so I suggest Player 8 vote for Player 3 along with me.",

The identities of No. 5 and No. 6 are unknown, but if both were good, it would mean three werewolves are still in the game, and they could easily form a majority vote. Given that there's no sign of werewolves forming a majority vote in today's speeches, I deduce that either No. 5 or No. 6 was a werewolf. No. 3 claimed No. 4 as a bad identity, but completely failed to define the roles of No. 5, 6, and 7 who died last night. I believe No. 3's perspective is flawed, and this behavior doesn't meet the expectations of a good player for a real seer. It's more like a speech from a werewolf pretending to be a seer. Therefore, I think No. 4 is the real seer, and No. 3 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer. This round, I will vote for No. 3 to be eliminated.",
