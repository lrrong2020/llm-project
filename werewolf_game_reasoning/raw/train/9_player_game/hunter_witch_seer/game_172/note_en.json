No.2 will side with the later Seer claim or remain neutral.\n- **Player 3**:\n  - Claiming to be a villager, thinks No.8 and No.9 seem good, analyzes if No.1 is a werewolf, then werewolves are No.1, No.4, No.5; if No.1 is the Seer, then werewolves are No.2, No.6, and either No.4 or No.5.\n  - No.3 analyzed both scenarios, aside from hastily defending No.8 and No.9 (which is odd since No.3 claims to be a villager and No.8 and No.9 also claimed to be villagers, so No.3's lack of suspicion is strange), other analyses follow positive logic without issues.\n- **Player 4**:\n  - Claiming to be a villager, finds No.1's speech chaotic and illogical, thinks No.1 shouldn't check No.3, sides with the later Seer claim.\n- **Player 5**:\n  - Claiming to be a villager, believes at least one werewolf among No.8, No.9, No.3, No.4, thinks No.6 claiming Seer immediately after being accused is unlikely to be the real Seer, sides with No.1, will vote for No.6 this round.\n- **Player 6**:\n  - Claiming to be the Seer, reports No.7 as good identity, explained reasoning for checking No.7, believes No.8 and No.9 are good, thinks No.3 and No.5 are likely werewolves, votes for No.1 this round.\n\n# Identity Predictions for This Round\n- **No.1**: Werewolf\n- **No.2**: Hunter\n- **No.3**: Villager\n- **No.4**: Villager\n- **No.5**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **No.6**: Seer\n- **No.7**: Witch\n- **No.8**: Villager or Werewolf\n- **No.9**: Villager or Werewolf",
