No.6 was the last to speak, so how could there be anyone speaking after No.6? No.7's speech is utterly ridiculous!

I hope the players who haven't spoken yet won't use weak arguments like \"Player 2's reasoning for checking seems made up\" or \"Player 2 is reaching too far\" to attack me. If you want to challenge me, please use solid logic! I must say this speaking order is very unfavorable for me. I thought I'd likely speak first today, which would give my accusation against player 7 more weight. But God let the werewolf player 7 speak first - talk about the guilty party filing the suit first! I don't even want to point out all of player 7's mistakes. They completely failed to analyze the situation, focusing solely on player 6 throughout their speech. In your view, player 7, isn't player 6 already confirmed as a werewolf? Why are you so fixated on them? Player 7's perspective is far too narrow, outputting only about player 6 and not paying attention to any other player. This is not the viewpoint a good player should have. Player 9 pointed out another mistake of player 7 - even though player 6 spoke last, player 7 somehow suggested that 6's teammates who speak after could help defend them. This is a clear slip-up that I hadn't even noticed, but player 9 helpfully pointed it out. Player 9 is truly my capable assistant, so I'm certain they are on the good team! If I'm unfortunately killed by the werewolves tonight, I'll entrust the task of eliminating the werewolves to player 9. I believe with player 9, a definite good player, leading the team, we will surely be victorious against the werewolves! For now, I tentatively think player 8 is the Witch, since no one has claimed to be the Witch against them. The true and fake Witches can sort it out at night; it's not my concern. Player 1 directly sided with player 7, who's pretending to be the Seer, praising them excessively. Honestly, player 1's speech was so blatant that I can hardly believe they're a charge wolf. Surely the werewolves aren't stupid enough to firmly side with player 7 without even analyzing both sides' logic? I think player 1's speech was very foolish, but whether they're a foolish villager or a foolish werewolf, I can't be sure. Tonight, I will check the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on the voting pattern. Please join me in voting out player 7, the werewolf!",

Secondly, No. 3 werewolf pretended to be a hunter and sided with No. 2, so I believe No. 3 can only be No. 2's werewolf teammate. This round, No. 3 pretended to be a hunter to help No. 2, who is pretending to be a seer. No. 2's speech shows that they don't dare to accuse No. 1 of being a werewolf, which seems to be laying the groundwork for their own \"werewolf position\". Because from No. 2's perspective, No. 7 is pretending to be a seer, No. 3 and No. 5 are both claiming to be hunters (one of them is a werewolf), and No. 4 and No. 8 are both claiming to be witches (one of them is a werewolf). If No. 2 were to accuse No. 1 of being a werewolf, then there would be an extra werewolf in No. 2's \"werewolf position\", which is why No. 2 doesn't dare to accuse No. 1 of being a werewolf! Now, let me arrange the work: today, please vote for No. 3 werewolf with me. No. 4 and No. 8, who are both claiming to be witches, please resolve this tonight.

Based on Player 3's accusation yesterday and my verification result last night, I can now clearly tell everyone that the three werewolves are Players 5, 7, and 8. All other players in the outer positions are good! I'd like to address Player 1, the villager: the sea of suffering is boundless, turning back is the shore. I hope you haven't unknowingly lost yourself in the embrace of the werewolves. Please return to the good team in time and join us in lynching Player 7, who is pretending to be a seer! Even if you, Player 1, don't turn back, it doesn't matter. I still have my good teammates, Players 6 and 9. Our three votes can overpower your two votes! Victory will ultimately triumph over evil.

            "reason": "Even as we enter the second day of the game, I stand by my judgment from the previous round: Player 2 is the Seer, and Player 7 is pretending to be the Seer. Based on this, let's analyze the situation.\n\nWhat I should do now:\n\n- **Vote for Player 7**: Since I believe Player 2 is the true Seer, Player 7 can only be a werewolf pretending to be the Seer. Player 7 claims that Players 2, 6, and 5 are the three werewolves, but there's still another werewolf to be identified among Players 4 and 8, who both claimed to be the Witch on the first day. From Player 7's perspective, this would mean there are currently four werewolves in the game, which is impossible. Therefore, Player 7's position as a werewolf has been exposed, and they can only be a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I've decided to vote for Player 7.",
