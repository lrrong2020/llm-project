I am a villager.\n- **Player 4**: Claims witch, gives silver to Player 6, suspects Player 3 might be a werewolf. I think Player 5 claims to be the witch, I believe Player 5 is a werewolf identified by Player 4, Player 4 gives silver to Player 6, I think Player 4 and Player 6 might be two werewolves pretending to be each other's roles.\n- **Player 5**: Claims seer, identifies Player 4 as bad, believes Players 4 and 6 are werewolves, plans to check Players 8 and 9 tonight, thinks Player 3 is good, wants to vote out Player 4. I analyze that Player 5 claims to be the seer and identifies Player 4 as bad, their speech is standard, but Players 4 and 6's speeches clearly indicate they are two werewolves who met at night, so I believe Player 5 is the seer.\n- **Player 6**: Claims seer, identifies Player 1 as bad, believes Player 4 is the witch, wants to vote out Player 1, plans to check Player 3's identity tonight. I analyze that Player 6 directly acknowledges Player 4 as the witch, I think Players 4 and 6 are two werewolves pretending to be each other's roles, and because I'm throwing suspicion on Player 4 in my speech, Player 6, as Player 4's werewolf teammate, wants to frame me (Player 3) for elimination, so I believe Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the seer.\n- **Player 7**: Claims villager, believes Player 5 is the seer, thinks Players 4 and 6 are both werewolves, wants to vote out Player 4. I analyze that Player 7 carefully analyzes the situation, I think Player 7 is a non-special villager.\n- **Player 8**: Claims witch, believes Player 5 is the seer, gives silver to Player 6, thinks Player 1 is good, wants to vote out Player 4, plans to poison Player 6 tonight. I analyze that Player 8's speech carefully analyzes the situation, their speech aligns with a good player's perspective, I believe Player 8 is the real witch.\n- **Player 9**: Claims hunter, thinks Player 1 is a werewolf, believes Player 6 is the seer, thinks Players 3 and 5 are werewolves, wants to vote out Player 1, asks Player 4 (witch) to poison Player 5 tonight. I analyze that Player 9 claims to be the hunter and blindly sides with Player 6, I think Player 9 might be Player 6's werewolf teammate acting as a supporter.\n- **Player 1**: Claims hunter, believes Players 4, 6, and 9 are the three werewolves, wants to vote between Players 1 and 9, wants to vote out Player 9. I analyze that Player 1's werewolf suspects align with mine, I think Player 1 is the real hunter.\n- **Player 2**: Claims villager, thinks the werewolves are Players 4, 6, and 9, believes Player 5 is the seer, Player 8 is the witch, Player 1 is the hunter, thinks Player 5 is the seer, wants to vote out Player 4. I analyze that Player 2 carefully analyzes the situation, I think Player 2 is a non-special villager.\n\n# My Vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 4.\n\n# Identity Judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Hunter\n- **Player 2**: Villager\n- **Player 3**: Villager\n- **Player 4**: Werewolf\n- **Player 5**: Seer\n- **Player 6**: Werewolf\n- **Player 7**: Villager\n- **Player 8**: Witch\n- **Player 9**: Werewolf",
