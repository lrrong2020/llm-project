Among the players who spoke earlier, Players 2 and 4 both claimed to be the Witch. Player 7 simply suggested that Players 2 and 4 should resolve this issue themselves at night, without analyzing which of them is the real Witch or discussing the current situation. This lacks the perspective of a Seer. If Player 7 is the Seer, I believe their speech is extremely irresponsible towards the good team.\n\nRegarding Players 2 and 4 both claiming to be the Witch, if Player 4 is the real Witch, there's no need to reveal their identity during the day. They could simply poison Player 2 at night. I believe the real Witch wouldn't be foolish enough to reveal themselves when there's already a werewolf pretending to be the Witch among the earlier speakers, as this would only make them a target for the werewolves. Therefore, I believe Player 2 is the Witch, and Player 4 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch.\n\nI trust that Player 3 is the Seer. Player 3 gave Player 6 a good identity, and Player 6 claimed to be the Hunter. From my perspective, Player 6 must be the real Hunter. Player 5 also claimed to be the Hunter, contradicting Player 6, so Player 5 must be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player 5 this round.",

If we vote out a werewolf, that's ideal. If we vote out the Hunter, there's no need to worry. The Hunter can shoot a werewolf, the Witch can poison another werewolf at night, and tomorrow we can eliminate the last remaining werewolf. Perfect!",

This indicates that all three werewolves are among these six players.\n- The best choice today is to vote between players 5 and 6, who are both claiming to be the Hunter. This is because the Hunter can prove their identity by shooting, allowing us to clearly determine whether the player eliminated today is a werewolf or not.\n\n# Hunter identity analysis:\n- **Player 5**: Claimed to be the Hunter early in the speaking order but didn't side with anyone. I believe if player 5 were the real Hunter, there would be no need to claim this role without identifying the Seer. Moreover, player 5 is not in a critical position and faces no risk of elimination. If player 5 were the Hunter, they could use the Seer's feedback to help choose a side, rather than claiming to be the Hunter and then stating they won't choose a side yet. Therefore, I think player 5 is likely a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter to find the real Hunter.\n- **Player 6**: Player 6's speech was brief, making it difficult to determine if they are the Hunter. However, since I believe player 5 is a werewolf, by process of elimination, player 6 must be the Hunter.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe voting for player 5 is the best choice this round.",
