I also want the Witch to know not to waste their poison on me. Players 4, 5, and 6 immediately claimed to be villagers, which makes me think the villager pool will be chaotic. I'll listen to the Seer's verification. The front positions are likely werewolves, so if 4, 5, and 6 are all villagers, with me as the Guard, that leaves three werewolves, a Seer, and a Witch in the back positions. That would be intense. Regarding the speeches of 4, 5, and 6, player 6's speech aligns more with a good person's perspective. I can accept player 6 as good. Between 4 and 5, I think player 5 seems more like a werewolf, though it's possible that 4 and 5 are both werewolves or one good person and one werewolf. Player 7 also claimed to be a Seer and declared player 5 as a good identity. My speech mainly attacked player 5, and now you're declaring them as good. I don't want to side with you; I don't think you're a real Seer. Even if you had declared player 6 as good, I would have sided with you. As a Guard, I'm directly siding with the Seer in the back positions. Player 7's perspective completely fails to align with a good person's view. Their speech was terrible, and they said, \"The back 5 players might have a situation of 2 werewolves pretending to be the Seer out of 5,\" but shouldn't it be 3 werewolves out of 5 players? Do they have a werewolf mark on their head? I won't disclose who I protected last night, but tonight I will definitely protect one of the Seers in the back positions, even if it means I'll be eliminated. The Seer is more important than me. If the Witch trusts me, choose to poison player 7. If you reveal yourself, report who was attacked last night.",

Player 5, being the second to speak, still gave a vague speech, so I think player 5's speech wasn't as good as player 4's. The guard revealed their identity on the first day. If the witch also comes out to report their silver water, then all three special roles would be revealed, leaving no room for error.

Here's my analysis of the previous players' speeches:\n\nPlayer 4 had no unnecessary actions and didn't give player 5 time to prepare, so they're likely good. Player 6 believes that at least one werewolf is among players 4 and 5, which aligns with my conclusion. If player 6 votes for player 5 with me this round, I'll consider them good; otherwise, I'll check player 6 tonight. Player 8 attacked player 5, so I think player 8 is good. Player 9 also attacked player 5, so I believe player 9 is good as well.\n\nLastly, let's discuss player 7. They think there are two werewolves among the five players after them, meaning one werewolf among players 4, 5, and 6. Player 7 also believes player 6's identity is more trustworthy than player 4's. So why would player 7 still want to check player 4? This is a logical contradiction and a reason why player 7 can't be the real Seer. I hope the good players can recognize this and determine that I am the true Seer.\n\nTo summarize: Player 5 is the werewolf I identified. Player 7 is pretending to be the Seer. Players 4, 8, and 9 are all good. If player 6 votes correctly this round, they're also good, and tonight I'll look for the last werewolf between players 2 and 3. If player 6 votes for a werewolf, I'll check player 6 tonight. At least one of players 2 and 3 must be good. If you find any issues with my speech, please point them out, as I need the votes from good players and will consider their opinions.\n\nI'm voting for player 5 this round. If the Witch trusts me, they can use their poison on player 7. This concludes my speech.",

You also said you're a player without night actions, but it seems you're speaking with your big, watery eyes wide open. Why must there be one wolf among No. 4 and No. 5 if they both claim to be villagers? Why can't they both be good guys? No. 6's speech is completely filled with information that only a werewolf would know. I order the Witch to poison No. 6 tonight. If you don't poison No. 6, then poison me, No. 2. After strongly accusing No. 6, let's \"objectively evaluate\" you, No. 7. You said \"No. 6's speech was very reasonable.\" Oh my goodness! Did I hear that right? No. 6's speech was so explosive, yet you say it was reasonable. I'm sorry, but after your speech, No. 7, No. 5's fate today seems sealed. Today you must pay for your words and actions. You'll be out, of course, but not today. Today we'll eliminate No. 5 first, leaving you, No. 7, for another day. If tomorrow you suddenly change your tune and say with deep remorse that you didn't realize No. 6 was a werewolf yesterday, that you're deeply sorry and want to start anew, then I might support you with one vote and help you vote out No. 1 tomorrow.

So I can only assume that Players 5 and 7 are a pair of werewolves. This round, I firmly stand with Player 1. I believe Player 1 is the legendary seer in my heart! Player 8 claimed to be the guard, and their speech logic is very correct, so they must be the real guard. Player 2's speech was very relaxed, and generally, werewolves don't act like that, right? Today, I will definitely vote for Player 5, and the witch can just poison Player 7 tonight. Tomorrow, we can eliminate from the few cards who claimed to be villagers. The good team has enough rounds.

Player 7's assessment of player 6's earlier speech is impartial, but I believe player 7's perspective is entirely incorrect. A villager, after hearing player 6's speech, would definitely attack player 6, as their speech contained a lot of information.

Since player 5 is my silver water (saved by the witch), I think if player 1 were a werewolf who killed player 5 at night, they probably wouldn't dare to declare player 5 as bad identity during the day. Attacking the witch's silver water would likely anger the witch and possibly result in being poisoned.

Let me explain why I chose to check player 6. Yesterday, I believed the werewolves could only be among players 2, 3, and 6. Player 2 attacked player 6, and player 3 expressed willingness to go to the PK stage. So, I decided to check player 6. The result may not be ideal, but fortunately, there's only one werewolf left, and the good team still has a high chance of winning.\n\nBetween players 2 and 3, I think player 3 is more likely to be a werewolf. If player 2 were a reverse-hook werewolf, they wouldn't need to attack player 6, who is good, or at least not attack so aggressively. Moreover, player 3 thought player 2 was biased and wanted to PK with the villagers in the outer positions. But which outer position players did player 3 think were werewolves? Player 3 didn't point that out yesterday. Therefore, at this point, I'm more inclined to believe player 3 is a werewolf.\n\nHowever, I won't call for a vote against player 3 in my position because everyone hasn't spoken yet, and I haven't had a second update. So I can't be certain that player 3 is definitely a werewolf. Also, players 4 and 9, whom I protected yesterday, might have issues as well. It's hard to say. So this round, let's wait for player 8, the guard, to speak and then call for a vote. Player 8 will be able to hear the updated speeches from players 2, 3, and 4 this round, and can then call for a vote against the last werewolf.",

This means No. 7, the Seer, was killed by werewolves, and No. 6 must have been poisoned by the Witch. You, No. 1, gave No. 6 a good identity today? That's fine, but now you don't need to say anything more. You can join them (No. 6 and No. 7) on their way out. No. 8, you little player, you seem to enjoy pretending to be me, don't you? Confess now for leniency, or face severe consequences if you resist. Today, I'll give you, No. 8, a chance to reveal your true identity. If you don't, we'll vote out No. 1 today and eliminate you tomorrow. There's also an iron-clad logic: if No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 were all good people, the game would have ended with the werewolves winning by block voting. So No. 6 must be a werewolf. Yesterday, when I said I'd poison either No. 6 or No. 2, I was taking a gamble. I believed that with No. 6's disastrous speech, the Witch wouldn't poison me instead of No. 6. Today, the Witch can claim they used the poison, and then we can vote out No. 1 and No. 8 in that order.",

I haven't heard updated speeches from the later positions, players 4, 8, and 9. Let's listen to another round.

The reason I didn't reveal my identity as the Witch on the first day is that I was the first to speak, and I couldn't guarantee that Player 5 was definitely good. So I decided to hide my identity on the first day, not wanting to reveal too much information to the werewolves. Player 7 was poisoned last night, and Player 6 was killed by the werewolves. Player 1 has already thoroughly analyzed why Player 7 cannot be the Seer. Player 7's speech, \"I am the Seer, Player 5 is my good identity, Player 6's identity is higher than Player 4's, but not killing Player 4 must mean they are a werewolf, and there might be a 5-to-2 pattern with a pretend Seer among the 5 remaining players,\" is self-contradictory. Since Player 7 said that 2 out of the 5 remaining players are werewolves, it implies that there is one werewolf among the earlier speakers. He believes Player 6's identity is better than Player 4's, which means Player 4 must be a werewolf in his eyes. His verification could only find werewolves among the remaining players, so Player 7 must be a werewolf. This round, Players 2 and 8 both claim to be the Guard. Currently, there is only one werewolf card on the table. I believe we have enough rounds. Even if voting for Player 2 doesn't end the game, we still have Player 1 as the Seer and Player 4 as the Witch. Voting for Player 8 afterwards would still result in a victory for the good team. Moreover, Player 2's speech in the previous round, \"Let's kill Player 5 today,\" was exaggerated. In conclusion, as the Witch, I vote for Player 2.",

Now that I've revealed my true identity, it should prove that I'm a good guy. Last night, Player 6 was killed. Now that both werewolves are out, the good team is ahead, so we can reveal our identities and play openly.

Fortunately, Player 4, the Witch, wisely didn't immediately try to save Player 5. Player 1 is the Seer, Player 2 is the Guard, Player 4 claims to be the Witch, and I, Player 8, am a good guy.

Under the premise that Player 1 and I are the two werewolves, how could Player 6 be a werewolf? Player 6 can only be a good guy, understand? Just follow the majority vote. You analyze that I'm a werewolf, but which part of my speech makes you think I'm a werewolf? Is it because I pretended to be the Guard? I've already revealed my true identity this round.

Player 5 claimed to be a villager on the first day, and I strongly accused Player 6. Player 6, as the witch, voted for Player 5 (Player 7's good identity) on the first day. On the second day, with both Player 6 and Player 7 dying, it's unlikely that Player 6 would have poisoned Player 7, but would likely have poisoned me instead. If Player 1 is a werewolf, the eliminated Player 5 can't be their teammate, Player 7's pretense as a seer doesn't make them Player 1's werewolf companion, and Player 6 being killed doesn't establish them as Player 1's werewolf teammate. Therefore, I conclude that Player 4 is the witch.\n\nIn summary, I trust Player 4 as the witch.\n\n# Based on Player 4 being the witch, I make the following identity judgments for other players:\n- **Player 1**: Seer, because Players 5, 6, and 7 cannot be Player 1's werewolf teammates. If Player 1 were a werewolf, there would be three werewolves on the field, leading to a binding vote victory. Therefore, by reverse logic, Player 1 is the seer.\n- **Player 8**: Good person. On the first day, they supported me, and on the second day, they withdrew support and wanted to vote out Player 3. Their behavior, not defending me as the guard, seems like that of a good person.\n\n# Werewolf Possibility Ranking:\n- 5 = 7 > 3 > 8 = 9\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 3.",
