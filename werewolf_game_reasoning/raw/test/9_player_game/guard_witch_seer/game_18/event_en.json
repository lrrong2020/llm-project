Second, if No. 1 were a werewolf, speaking first in such a rushed manner without preparation time doesn't make sense; it would be better to let a werewolf teammate in a later position pretend to be the Seer. Third, if No. 1 were a werewolf, they wouldn't dare to declare a good identity for a player in a later position who hasn't spoken yet, fearing that player might turn against them and claim to be the Seer. Considering all these points, I believe No. 1 is the Seer. Players in later positions shouldn't claim that \"No. 1 and No. 2 are both werewolves.\" If I were a werewolf, why would I openly support my werewolf teammate in an early position?

I can only say you're quite lucky, as you've thrown it to me, the real seer. I'm the seer, and last night I checked Number 5. Number 5 is my good identity. Let me explain my thought process for checking Number 5. I was aiming to check the middle positions for werewolves. I am indeed a seer, and what I can do for the good team is to use my ability and logic to find werewolves. I also believe the good players can accurately choose sides.\n\nSince I spoke in an early position on the first day, I currently can't provide werewolf positions for everyone. Last night was peaceful, so the witch can come forward and report their silver water. This way, I can gather all the information, and with my second day's check, I can stand up and provide werewolf positions for the good team. Regarding the players in later positions, I won't define them for now, as I don't have the werewolves' god's perspective. Currently, I can only vouch for Number 5. The players in later positions should also speak carefully.\n\nFirst, Number 1 and I can't possibly be on the same team. Number 1 gave me a good identity, and I immediately turned against them and stood guard. If there's another player in a later position pretending to be a seer to help Number 1, who's pretending to be a werewolf, they should also be treated as a werewolf and voluntarily accept the poison at night. Tonight, I want to choose between Number 8 and Number 9 in the last positions based on their speeches and alignments. Regardless of what they say, the voting pattern can determine everything. I hope the good team can analyze the werewolves' positions based on the voting pattern.\n\nI won't define Number 2's speech for now, as early position vote calls don't carry much weight. As for the guard, please protect me tonight. I'll report another round of checks tomorrow, fully opening up the situation. For today's vote, the good team should all vote for Number 1.",

Number 1 said, \"If Number 2 claims to be the seer, I'll check players from Number 4 to Number 9 in the later positions.\" So I ask you, Number 1, what if Number 2 doesn't claim to be the seer? Does your speech just end abruptly there? Shouldn't you check Number 2 if they don't claim? You won't run out of time to speak, will you? You won't run out of time to think, will you? You won't run out of time to double-check if you've missed anything in your speech, will you? Unbelievable, right? I had prepared this speech even before Number 3 claimed to be the seer. Wow, what a surprise, they've been exposed by the real seer's counter-claim. How satisfying! In one word: awesome! Too bad Number 1 doesn't have a self-destruct function and can only endure the constant humiliation and verbal beating from the good team. And you, Number 2, all three of your points are false logic. I'll refute them one by one. First point: If Number 1 is a werewolf, giving a bad identity to a later position would definitely have more weight than giving a good identity. It's precisely because there might be a seer in the later positions who could counter-claim and expose the fake seer, so giving a good identity to a later position carries more weight than giving a bad identity. Second point: If Number 1 is a werewolf, speaking first in such a rush without any preparation time, it would be better to let a werewolf teammate in a later position claim to be the seer. Utter nonsense! Whoever was arranged to claim during the night is the one who claims. Werewolves can also discuss who will speak first and pretend to be the seer. Your reasoning doesn't hold up at all. Third point: If Number 1 is a werewolf, they dare to give a good identity to a player in a later position who hasn't spoken yet, not fearing that there might be a real seer with a good identity. Number 3 could also be Number 1's werewolf teammate! Number 1 and Number 2 could be two werewolves giving each other good identities, which isn't difficult at all and ensures they won't accidentally give a good identity to the real seer. In conclusion, Number 1 and Number 2, two werewolves, are already exposed. Today, I side with Number 3 as the seer. We should vote out Number 1, the fake seer. The Witch should poison Number 2, the aggressive werewolf. And the remaining werewolf in the later positions must be trembling with fear!",

Firstly, Player 1 can give a good identity to their teammate. Secondly, given how long the game has been going, anyone who speaks first will naturally develop some logic. I think even I could fabricate something. Thirdly, Player 1 chose to take a risk. Excluding their teammate, there's a one-in-five chance of falsely claiming a good identity. If they actually manage to bluff as the seer, Player 1 would have to accept it. So, Player 2, don't say I'm forcing anything on you. I've directly refuted all your logic, so you, Player 2, could also be a werewolf, rushing to support Player 1. I'm still the good identity of Player 3, the seer.

Therefore, I think player 2 is player 1's werewolf teammate. If either player 8 or 9 still claims to be the seer, let's call them player X. We should then determine the real seer between players 3 and X based on their speeches. If player 3 is the seer, the werewolves are players 1, 2, and X, identifying all three werewolves. If player X is the seer, the werewolves are players 1 and 3, with the last werewolf likely being player 5. I suggest player X verify player 5's identity because if players 1 and 3 are indeed werewolves, the only benefit for the werewolf team would be to elevate player 5's status. Currently, player 3's speech this round doesn't have many issues, and I can't determine player 5's identity from their speech.

If No.8 were a werewolf, they could have easily hidden their identity without needing to claim the Witch role and risk being poisoned.

Now all the villagers believe I'm Player 1's supporting werewolf.\n\nPros and cons analysis:\n- Voting for Player 1: This might barely convince the villagers that I'm no longer siding with Player 1, potentially gaining trust from a very small number of villagers. However, it's unlikely to change the overall situation significantly.\n- Voting for Player 3: This would further confirm my werewolf identity, and I would likely be poisoned by the witch during the night and eliminated.\n\nConsidering all factors, I believe voting for Player 1 is the better choice.",

They briefly mentioned that the later speakers shouldn't analyze whether Players 1 and 2 are both werewolves.

However, No. 6's statement about No. 5 being a villager doesn't make sense, unless No. 6 is actually the Guard. Otherwise, this comment from No. 6 is truly baffling.

Excluding this highly improbable scenario, if Player 3 is the Seer who identified Player 9 as bad, I believe voting out Player 9 today will likely end the game.
