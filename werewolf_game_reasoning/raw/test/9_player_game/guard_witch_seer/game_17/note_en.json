Speech starts from No. 9.\n\nSpeech and behavior analysis\n- Player 9: Claims to be the Seer, declares No. 2 as bad identity. Calls for a vote on No. 2.\n  - Subjective analysis: Werewolf teammate.\n\n- Player 1: Softly supports the later-positioned Seer. Believes No. 9 is unlikely to be the real Seer.\n  - Subjective analysis: I am a werewolf.\n\n- Player 2: Villager. Thinks No. 9 is a werewolf. Suggests later-positioned Seer to vote for the bad identity if they have one, otherwise vote for No. 9.\n  - Subjective analysis: Villager, Guard.\n\n- Player 3: Witch. No. 4 is saved. Supports the later-positioned Seer. Will poison No. 1 tonight.\n  - Subjective analysis: Witch.\n\n- Player 4: Believes No. 3 is the real Witch. Thinks No. 9's speech was too brief. Chooses to support the later-positioned Seer.\n  - Subjective analysis: Villager, Guard.\n\n- Player 5: Villager. Thinks No. 9's speech was poor, and No. 2's response to being declared as bad identity was also mediocre. Chooses to support the later-positioned Seer. Wants to hear No. 2's speech in the next round.\n  - Subjective analysis: Werewolf teammate.\n\n- Player 6: Seer. No. 5 is bad identity. No. 9 is pretending to be the Seer. Calls for a vote on No. 5, will poison No. 9 at night. Will choose to check either No. 7 or No. 8 based on their speeches. Since No. 5 is bad identity and sided with No. 2, deduces that No. 2 might be good.\n  - Subjective analysis: Seer.\n\n- Player 7: Analyzes the situation. No. 9's speech was too brief to even be considered a werewolf's pretense. This caught No. 1 off guard, so No. 1 and No. 9 are likely not on the same team. Hopes No. 3 Witch will be cautious when using the poison. No. 2, who was declared as bad identity by No. 9, only claimed to be a villager without further analysis. Believes No. 6's statement \"Does No. 9's speech imply that there's a werewolf teammate in the later positions who will support his claim, so I'll check either No. 7 or No. 8 tonight\" doesn't align with a Seer's perspective. If No. 8 doesn't claim to be the Seer, will support No. 6.\n  - Subjective analysis: Villager, Guard.\n\n- Player 8: Supports No. 9 and will vote for No. 1. Thinks No. 6's speech doesn't analyze the identities of No. 1, 3, and 4, and directly looking for No. 9's supporting werewolf among No. 7 and 8 is not from a real Seer's perspective.\n  - Subjective analysis: Villager.",

The werewolves attacked No.4 during the night, and I used the healing potion.\n\nSpeech records:\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf & Seer\nPlayer 9:\n- Claiming to be the seer with only 18 characters? Can this be the real seer? I don't believe it.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf\nPlayer 1:\n- I think Player 1's perspective is off. He says that this speech state seems to be squeezing Player 2's identity rather than giving me, Player 1, a good identity. Is there a possibility that Players 1 and 9 are both werewolves, which is why they're not giving you a good identity?\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager\nPlayer 2:\n- Claiming to be a villager. Player 9 must be a werewolf. If the real seer had a bad identity, they would have revealed it. If not, we should vote out Player 9 today.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Witch\nPlayer 3:\n- I'm directly siding with the player who claimed to be the seer in the later position. I'll use the poison on Player 1 tonight.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Good\nPlayer 4:\n- I believe Player 3 is the witch. I'm siding with the player who claimed to be the seer in the later position.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf\nPlayer 5:\n- I think Player 2's speech about good identity wasn't convincing, and they don't believe Player 9 is the seer. They choose to side with the seer who claimed later. Isn't this contradictory? Must be a werewolf.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Seer\nPlayer 6:\n- I'm giving Player 5 a bad identity. Tonight I'll check either Player 7 or Player 8.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Good\nPlayer 7:\n- I think Player 9 is trying to trick Player 2 about their identity. If no one else claims to be the seer later, I'll side with Player 6. If there are more claims, I'll listen to their speeches before deciding.\n\nSubjective identity judgment: Good & Werewolf\nPlayer 8:\n- How can anyone still side with Player 9?
