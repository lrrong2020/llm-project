Last night, Player 3 was stabbed, but I suspected Player 3 was a self-stabbing werewolf, so I didn't use my healing potion. For some reason, I suddenly had a moment of madness and poisoned Player 7 next to me! Player 6 claimed to be the Seer and said Player 7 was a good identity. I don't think werewolves would need to give a good identity to a player who's already out, as there's no benefit in doing so. Also, Player 6's speech in the first position was sincere and full, so I believe in Player 6's Seer identity! Now that we know Player 7 was definitely a good person, I just hope Player 3 was a self-stabbing werewolf who's out. If Player 3 was also a good person, then we're in an extremely disadvantageous position! Anyway, I still have a healing potion left. If the Guard is still in the game, they can protect me tonight, and I'll save the stabbed player to ensure tomorrow is a peaceful night! I'm revealing myself as the second speaker to prevent any werewolves in later positions from impersonating me and confusing the good team's perspective! If any players in later positions pretend to be the Witch, we should treat them as werewolves. I don't need villagers to take the hit for me either! I currently side with Player 6, and since Players 6, 7, and 8 are all good, I think Players 5 and 9 should explain themselves well! Let's see if anyone in later positions claims to be the Seer. If so, we'll vote between the two players claiming to be the Seer today; if not, we'll vote for the player with the worst speech!",

I think Player 6's attempt to vouch for Player 7, who is already out of the game, carries almost no weight. Player 8 claimed to be the witch and said that Player 6's speech was \"sincere and full,\" but I disagree with Player 8's opinion. Player 6's speech content didn't even reach half the length of Player 8's. Player 8's perspective seems too advanced, believing that both Players 6 and 7 are good, and asking me and Player 5 to reveal our identities. I think Player 8 is preemptively defending against me and Player 5. With two players eliminated on the first night, I assume the witch was killed and then used the poison. Player 8 claiming to be the witch is likely a werewolf pretending to be the witch to trick the guard into protecting them, and then possibly killing the guard or the seer. This is a tactic I've often used when playing as a werewolf in previous games. I believe Players 6 and 8 are on the same side, and I might side with the players in later speaking positions.",

In contrast, No. 2's accusations against No. 6 and No. 8 were well-reasoned. Therefore, I believe No. 2 is the Seer and No. 6 is a werewolf. Second, I suspect No. 8 might be a werewolf because their speech contradicts No. 6's logic on three points, yet they still side with No. 6: No. 6 thinks No. 3 is good, while No. 8 believes No. 3 is a werewolf; No. 6 claims the Witch is already out, but No. 8 claims to be the Witch, indicating the Witch is still alive; No. 6 thinks No. 8 is a werewolf, but No. 8 believes No. 6 is the Seer.

Otherwise, if two good players are eliminated, the good team will be at a severe disadvantage. Therefore, I believe either Player 3 or Player 7 is likely the witch, who could only poison the other player after being stabbed. Moreover, even though Player 6 threw a water bag at Player 8, Player 8 still sided with Player 6 without hesitation. Thus, I think Player 8 is Player 6's werewolf teammate.\n- Player 2 gave Player 3 a bad identity. They believe Players 6 and 8 are werewolves, defining Players 3, 6, and 8 as three werewolves.\nTherefore, I judge that Players 6 and 8 are werewolves, and Player 2 is the seer. In conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 6.",

The game hasn't ended today, which proves that Players 3 and 7 are both good, and one of them is likely to be the Witch! Today, we should all vote to eliminate Player 5. Player 5 is definitely the last werewolf. Yesterday, in their final position speech, Player 5 made a mistake by saying, \"Today, I dare to call for votes against Player 8. Those who are brave, vote with me against Player 8.\" I think you've figured out my identity as the Seer, haven't you? That's why you wanted to vote me out on the first day.

This indicates that Player 6 and Player 8 are definitely on the same side. Therefore, Player 8 must be a werewolf.\nBased on the above, I've decided to vote for Player 8.",

Secondly, Player 8 now claims to be the Seer today.
