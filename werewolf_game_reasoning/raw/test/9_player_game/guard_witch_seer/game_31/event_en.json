I'm currently skeptical about Player 4's claim to be the Witch; they could either be a werewolf pretending to be the Witch or the real Witch. To the werewolf in the later speaking positions, with the strength of my verification, if you reveal yourself, it's equivalent to suicide! Player 6 believes that Player 4 is the real Witch without any doubt, which seems to me like they have inside information. Either Player 6 knows Player 4 is good and thus believes they are the real Witch, or Players 4 and 6 are both werewolves, so Player 6 directly supports Player 4. Tonight, I will verify Player 6's identity. Whether Player 4 is the real Witch or not, the Guard in the later positions should judge for themselves, but I remain skeptical! This round, I'm voting for the werewolf pretending to be the Seer in the later positions! If the cowardly werewolf in the later positions doesn't dare to claim to be the Seer, my verified good player will be the last to speak. Player 3, you can decide your vote after hearing everyone's speech. The vote of my verified good player represents my vote!",
