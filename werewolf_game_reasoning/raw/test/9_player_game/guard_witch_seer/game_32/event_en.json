Since I mentioned in my speech that I would vote for Player 1 today, if I don't vote for Player 1, the good players will think my words and actions are inconsistent, making it easier to expose my werewolf identity. Therefore, I should vote for Player 1 this round.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 1.",
