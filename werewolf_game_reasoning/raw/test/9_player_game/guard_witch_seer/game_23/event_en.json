I don't think player 9 could have been saved by both the Guard and the Witch simultaneously; the probability of that is extremely low. Now, let me analyze the current situation: The Witch still has one healing potion and one poison potion, I'm the Seer and present, the Guard is also here, and there are only two werewolves left. The good team has a significant advantage! To any werewolf in the later positions planning to pretend to be a Seer, feel free to reveal yourself and make it easy for us. Otherwise, I'm afraid we might mistakenly vote out a good player today! The speeches from players 6 and 7 in the earlier positions were rather vague, so I can't directly define their identities. I will listen to all players' speeches and, based on the voting results, verify the most suspicious player tonight! Today, the Witch and Guard should coordinate well and exchange information. The Guard should protect the Witch tonight, ensuring tomorrow will be another peaceful night. I hope the Witch and Guard can work together seamlessly! Today, let's all vote to eliminate the werewolf pretending to be a Seer in the later positions. If it turns out to be a timid werewolf situation, then everyone should vote for the player with the worst speech!",

From this, we can deduce that the eliminated player number 9 was the real seer.\n- Player number 5, speaking in the last position, arranged a tie vote for a showdown. They told me (number 8) to abstain from voting, otherwise, they would have the witch poison me.\n\nIn conclusion, to prove my \"seer\" identity and gain the trust of the good team, I must follow player number 5's arrangement. I cannot vote for any good player, as it would raise suspicion among the good team and be detrimental to the werewolf team's survival. Therefore, I choose to abstain from voting this round.",

If No. 5 were a werewolf, they could have easily fabricated some flowery words in the last position to mislead everyone to vote for a good person, but No. 5 didn't do that, so they have the thought process of a good person. In yesterday's speeches, I honestly didn't hear any slip-ups, and the werewolves were all trying to frame me, so I rightfully chose to abstain from voting! Based on yesterday's voting pattern, No. 3 voted for No. 5 and didn't follow No. 5's arrangement, which was very suspicious, so I went to verify No. 3, and they turned out to be a werewolf! The witch is absolutely the MVP this round, not saving the self-stabbing werewolf on the first night, and accurately poisoning a werewolf on the second night! But we still can't let our guard down, if both No. 5 and No. 7 are villagers, we still have no room for error! Today, No. 4 analyzed the logic of No. 5 being a good person and thought that No. 2, who spoke briefly, might be problematic, which aligns with my view; No. 6 analyzed the situation on the field and believed the last werewolf is either No. 1 or No. 2, which matches my analysis of the werewolf positions! Today, I think we can put No. 1 and No. 2 on the PK stage. No. 2's speech was too brief, and I really can't let it go. We haven't seen No. 1's updated speech yet.

Yesterday, I feared No. 9 might be a guard who was attacked, so I didn't reveal my identity as I would likely be targeted at night. I'll explain why I didn't save anyone last night: First, it wasn't the Seer No. 8 who was attacked, but No. 7 with an unknown identity. Second, No. 7's speech on the first day was vague without substantial information, so I couldn't determine if No. 7 was a werewolf faking their own death. I find No. 5's speech more reliable, showing good behavior, but No. 3 cast an unusual vote against No. 5, a good player. Thus, I define No. 3 as an aggressive werewolf. I can vouch for No. 4's speeches in both rounds, believing them to be good. Currently, only No. 2 and No. 6 have lower credibility. I think we should vote for No. 2 first, as their speeches in both rounds were vague, possibly a low-profile werewolf. This round, all good players should vote for No. 2.",

The real seer might have been the killed Player 9.\n\n- **Player 1**: The only one claiming to be the witch, so we can't vote for Player 1 this round.\n\n- **Player 2**: Based on Player 8's intention to vote out Player 1 or 2, and Player 1 being recognized as the witch (a good role), Player 2 is likely another good player that Player 8 wants to protect from being voted out.\n\n- **Player 6**: Player 6 didn't vote yesterday and gave a vague speech today, but no one mentioned them.
