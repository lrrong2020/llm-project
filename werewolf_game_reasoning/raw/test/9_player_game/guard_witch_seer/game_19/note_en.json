Highly likely to be the real Guard.\nSubjective identity judgment: Guard\n\nPlayer 4: I am the Witch, Player 3 is my silver water.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Witch\n\nPlayer 5: Agrees with my view that Player 3 is the Guard but illogically attacks me. For now, I consider them a werewolf card making pointless conversation.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Werewolf\n\nPlayer 6: Believes Player 5 is good and Player 4 is a werewolf. Player 6 might be Player 5's werewolf teammate, looking for someone to vote for.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Werewolf\n\nPlayer 7: Provided basic comments on previous players' speeches, believes Player 6's identity is less credible than Player 5's, which aligns with my view. Can be temporarily considered a good person.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Villager\n\nPlayer 8: Claims to be a villager, believes Players 5 and 6 might be werewolves, which highly aligns with my opinion. Likely to be a real villager.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Villager\n\nPlayer 9: Claims to be the Seer, believes the werewolf suspects are Players 1, 2, and 6, which basically aligns with my judgment of werewolf positions. However, Player 9 concluded that Player 5 is good based on their attack on Player 4, which slightly differs from my thoughts.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Seer\n\nPlayer 1: Claimed to be the Seer after being identified as a werewolf, hinted that Player 2 (a werewolf teammate in a later position) should claim to be the Guard, and asked Player 2 to \"incite\" later players to side with Player 1. A real Seer would be unlikely to speak like this, as \"incite\" in the game specifically refers to werewolves stirring up trouble to gain the trust of good players.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Werewolf\n\nPlayer 2: Player 1's werewolf teammate, forced to claim to be the Guard as they are among the Seer's werewolf suspects.\n- Subjective identity judgment: Werewolf",
