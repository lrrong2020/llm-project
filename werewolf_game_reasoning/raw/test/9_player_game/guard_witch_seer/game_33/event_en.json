Moreover, Player 8 included me in the werewolf spots and still expects me to analyze carefully before deciding which side to take, which seems a bit too demanding. I believe Player 5 identifying Player 8 as a bad identity carries more weight than Player 8's analysis. Besides, Player 8 doesn't consider me a good person, so there's no need for me to curry favor with them. I'm voting for Player 8 this round.",

Although your voting pattern yesterday, player 2, shows that you switched sides, we can't rule out the possibility that 8 and 2 are both werewolves trying to manipulate the game. Player 8 might have intentionally declared you as a good identity to allow you to switch sides and improve your credibility! Yesterday, player 1 in the last position analyzed why player 8 made mistakes during their speech, so I think player 1 is more likely to be a good role. Player 4 claimed to be the Guard, and while it's still possible that the Guard could be either 7 or 9, I believe player 4's speech is more likely to support their claim as the Guard. Player 3's speech yesterday was just following others and not contributing much. I currently suspect the werewolves might be among players 2 and 3. If player 2 speaks well today, I'll vote for player 3! I strongly request that players 2 and 3 be put up for elimination.
