I believe Player 5 has a higher chance of being good compared to Players 3 and 4 because Player 5 considered the possibility of Player 9 being the Seer. Werewolves know they will definitely pretend to be the Seer, and only good players would consider whether Player 9 could be the Seer. Of course, it's possible that Player 5 is a werewolf acting this way, but comparatively, the identities of Players 3 and 4 need to be checked more urgently.

A seer should have a heart that embraces all good people in the game and be compassionate, rather than saying: \"Talking to Player 8, you don't need to support me anymore, I don't need you, just wait to be voted out tomorrow.\" This speech sounds more like a werewolf preparing to vote against a good person. Player 1, in your final speech, you shouldn't have only asked for votes from me and Player 6 (the witch); you should have asked for votes from all the good people. I have always had a saying when playing Werewolf: pretending to be a seer on the spot is worse than admitting to being a werewolf. I'm changing my stance!

Moreover, No. 2, despite being identified as good, is turning against No. 1 and wants to vote for them.\n\nPros and cons analysis:\n- **Voting for Player No. 1**: The advantage is that it will make the good players think I'm siding with the real seer, which helps conceal my werewolf identity. The disadvantage is that we'll lose a werewolf teammate, which is unfavorable for the werewolf team's survival in the later stages.\n- **Voting for Player No. 7**: The advantage is that voting out the seer increases the chances of werewolf victory. The disadvantage is that it's easy for the good players to suspect me as a werewolf, which is not conducive to hiding my identity.\n\nConsidering all factors, I believe voting for Player No. 1 is the better choice.",

Addressing number 2, the guard, because you didn't side with number 1, it led to the real seer being collectively voted out by the werewolves. Number 6, the witch, was probably influenced by your speech and voted out number 1 as well. I hope you two can reconsider, as the witch still has a poison potion that can help us good guys catch up on the rounds we've fallen behind. I believe number 7's claim of a bad identity for number 1 last round had no credibility, because 7 and 8 are two werewolves, and only numbers 1 and 2 hadn't spoken yet, so 7 could only declare a bad identity for the later speakers. I'm certain number 5 is a good guy because last round they voted for number 7 along with me. This round, I will vote for number 7, who is pretending to be a seer! If the two special role cards continue to be misguided this round, we'll only be left with the bitter fruit of defeat!",

Before Player 7 spoke, four players had already spoken, but Player 7 didn't analyze their speeches. Moreover, Player 8 said that if Player 1 claimed to be the seer, Player 8 would immediately side with Player 7. I think Player 8 didn't consider the possibility of Player 1 being the real seer at all. Player 8's behavior is not good and might be Player 7's werewolf teammate. Also, Players 4, 5, and 8 all claimed to be villagers, and Player 3 hinted at being a villager yesterday, making the villager role overcrowded. I believe at least one of Players 3, 4, and 8 is a werewolf. Player 1's speech yesterday at least analyzed the possibility of Players 3 and 4 being passive werewolves, indicating they would check one of them, so I think Player 1 might not be on the same side as Players 3 and 4. Therefore, I choose to side with Player 1 and voted for Player 7. Player 4 said if Player 9 isn't a werewolf who killed themselves, then Players 3 and 5 are both werewolves. So I think Player 4 might be a werewolf. If I, Player 5, were a werewolf, speaking before Player 7, I could have easily given a bad identity to a player in a later position, which would be better than Player 1's position to claim seer. But I am a villager card. Also, Player 4 said Player 9 is a werewolf who killed themselves, yet didn't attack Player 3, instead persuading Player 3 to change sides. So where is Player 4's werewolf position? Today I only express support for the Witch and Player 2 the Guard. I'll listen to Player 6 the Witch's vote suggestion. If Player 7 gives me a bad identity, it means they want to vote me out, and I will vote for Player 7.",

Yesterday, No. 3's speech accused No. 4, No. 7, and No. 8, believing that No. 5 voting for No. 7 on the first day indicates they are a good player. So, No. 5's identity is more credible than No. 3's. Voting patterns don't lie; No. 3's votes have always firmly supported their werewolf teammate, No. 1. Good players will consistently vote for who they believe to be werewolves. I chose the wrong side on the first day, but yesterday when No. 7 declared No. 4 as a bad identity, regardless of whether No. 7 or No. 1 is the seer, No. 4 is a werewolf in my eyes, so I voted for No. 4.
