My reasoning for checking player 9 was simple: if player 9 turned out to be a good identity, we could have pressured player 8 in the middle together, pinning down their identity. Player 6, who spoke before me, pretended to be a seer and declared me as a bad identity. I can only say you werewolves got lucky, successfully challenging me, the real Seer. So I've already identified two definite werewolves: players 6 and 9! With players 6 and 9 being the two werewolves, player 8, who died during the night, is likely to be good. If player 8 were a werewolf, I think player 6 would probably have declared someone before them as a good identity, rather than declaring someone after as a bad identity, which would limit the werewolf team's options. I can't define player 5's speech or determine their specific identity. The situation is now very clear. We should eliminate players 9 and 6 in that order. Today, I ask all the good players to follow me and vote unanimously to eliminate player 9, the confirmed werewolf. Don't split the votes. Tonight, the Witch should use the poison on player 6, the werewolf pretending to be a seer, and the Guard should protect me. I'll try to identify another werewolf tonight, so we can lead the game to victory tomorrow!",

Who is No. 7 referring to when they say \"give a good identity to someone earlier\"? Only No. 5 spoke before No. 6. If No. 7 thinks No. 5 is a werewolf, then this statement makes sense. But if No. 5 is good, then No. 6 giving No. 5 a good identity would actually limit the werewolf team's options! No. 7 didn't assess No. 5's identity but jumped to an illogical conclusion. I even suspect that No. 7 giving No. 9 a bad identity could be a werewolf identifying another werewolf, while No. 6 might be the real seer. I'm likely to vote for No. 9 this round.",

The speaking order is 6, then 7.\n- **Player 6**: Declares player 7 as a bad identity.\n- **Player 7**: Declares player 9 as a bad identity. After receiving the bad identity claim from player 6, player 7 immediately pretends to be a seer. If player 6 were a werewolf, the probability of giving a bad identity to a real seer in a later position would be low, so I believe player 6 is the true seer, and the credibility of their bad identity claim is high.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the true seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Assessments of Other Players Based on the Seer's Information:\n- **Player 7**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 6.\n- **Player 9**: Claims to be a villager after receiving a bad identity claim from player 7. Player 9 believes that a villager's elimination this round won't significantly impact the situation, a view I strongly disagree with. I think there's a possibility that player 7 gave player 9 a bad identity claim as a werewolf identifying another werewolf.\n\n# Ranking of Werewolf Possibilities:\n- 9>7>6\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 9.",

On the first night, I protected No. 9, fearing the Witch might not save anyone, so I randomly chose to protect No. 9, and indeed the Witch didn't use her potion. Yesterday, No. 9 didn't claim to be a Seer, so I naturally have some tolerance for them. I voted for No. 7 yesterday because if No. 9 was a werewolf who killed themselves, they didn't pretend to be a Seer or support one, indicating they sided with Seer No. 6, but their speech sounded like a werewolf. I think No. 9 seems very much like No. 7's werewolf teammate, intentionally setting up No. 6 to be voted out. I believe No. 1 is strongly pushing that No. 9 is a werewolf. If No. 9 is a werewolf, No. 1 chose to side with No. 7, but completely failed to analyze that No. 9's speech could be intentionally making themselves look like a werewolf, and No. 9 could be No. 7's werewolf partner. No. 2 deduced that No. 7 and No. 9 are both werewolves lynching each other, sided with No. 6 but didn't prioritize voting for No. 7, who was identified as a bad identity by No. 6. I think No. 2 is No. 7's werewolf teammate, siding with No. 6's camp, setting up No. 6, but wanting to vote for No. 9. Moreover, I carefully examined No. 9's speech and didn't find any part where they made mistakes during the speech as No. 1 claimed, and No. 1 didn't explain where these mistakes were. So I deduce that No. 1 might be a werewolf trying to vote for No. 9. No. 7, pretending to be a Seer, gave me, Guard No. 5, a bad identity. In my view, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 7 are three werewolf cards. But No. 3 today claimed to be a Guard, so I determine the werewolves to be No. 3 and No. 7, with either No. 1 or No. 2 being a villager who sided with the wrong team. No. 9 is a villager, No. 4 is the Witch, I'm the Guard No. 5. So No. 8, who was eliminated on the first day, is also a villager. No. 7 gave me, Guard No. 5, a bad identity, so as the Guard, I call for a vote against No. 7, who is pretending to be a Seer but is actually a werewolf. I'm addressing Witch No. 4, please reconsider your stance.",
