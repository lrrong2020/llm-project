I've caught two werewolves at once! My reasoning for checking player 8 was to verify every other player, potentially isolating player 7 in the middle. Unexpectedly, player 2, a werewolf, inadvertently confirmed the identity of the very player I had checked. Now, I only need to find one more werewolf among the later speakers.\n\nAnalyzing the earlier speeches: Player 3 claims to be a villager with a vague statement. Player 4 noted that no one contradicted player 2's claim and suggested voting for my identified werewolf, player 8. This could be an attempt to sway the villagers to side with player 2. I find player 4's behavior suspicious. Player 5's opinion that players 4 and 2 might be on the same side aligns with my thoughts, so I believe player 5 is likely a villager. I haven't heard from players 7, 9, and 1 yet, so I can't judge them at this point.\n\nIf any of the later speakers side with player 2, I will likely investigate them next. If they all side with me, I'll investigate player 4. I urge the Guard to protect me tonight so I can reveal another identity check tomorrow. I also ask the Witch to use the poison on player 2, who is pretending to be a Seer!\n\nTo all the villagers: As the Seer, I must consider that since my identified werewolf, player 8, will speak later, they might claim a special role to avoid elimination.

If the good team votes me out, I guarantee you'll never have peace again. Last night was peaceful, and I didn't guard anyone. The Witch has already used her potion. If you vote me, the real Guard, out today, there will never be another peaceful night. I believe Players 5 and 6 are both werewolves. Player 5 immediately refused to acknowledge Player 2 as the real Seer, so I ask, what's your reason for not recognizing Player 2? Player 8's speech: \"A message to all good players: As the Seer, I must consider that since my bad identity reveal of Player 8 comes late in the speaking order, he might claim a special role to avoid elimination. Don't believe his lies!\" Players 2 through 6 in the earlier speaking positions didn't claim to be the Witch. Only Players 7, 8, 9, and 1 in the later positions haven't spoken yet. He's afraid of revealing the real Witch, which is why he's speaking as if he has inside information. If there's a werewolf teammate of Player 6 in the later positions, please counter-claim my Guard role. This way, we'll clearly see all three werewolves today. I urge all good players to vote for Player 6 today. Player 2, the Seer, should verify Player 5. Good players, don't split your votes. The werewolves will definitely try to vote me, the real Guard, out. Everyone should vote for Player 6 today.",

Assuming you're the Seer, why don't you think Players 1 and 3 are werewolves? Using position analysis is incorrect to begin with, and you also stepped on the Guard's toes. Player 6's speech about Player 4's definition is also wrong. Player 4's evaluation of Player 2 considers Player 2's speech very confident, hoping Player 2 is the Seer. I believe Players 2 and 4 are not in cahoots. Player 8, how did you know someone would claim to be the Guard after you? Because you're not the Guard! Originally, I didn't intend to take sides, but thankfully Player 8 pretended to be the Guard, allowing me to effortlessly find my team, haha! Witch, please poison Player 2 tonight.

Player 8's Guard claim suggests that someone in a later position will also claim Guard. I believe if you, player 8, were really the Guard, given that you were accurately identified as bad by a werewolf in a later position, you should have pointed out which player in an earlier position is a werewolf, rather than letting your almighty Seer verify who you think is a werewolf. Player 7's speech also softly supports player 6, but you, player 8, only attacked player 5, completely ignoring player 7. Therefore, I don't think your perspective, player 8, is that of a good role!

Player 6, when claiming to be the Seer, mentioned that if the later players all side with them, they would verify me. I believe this mentality is not that of a true Seer. Comparing the speeches of Player 2 and Player 6, Player 2 seems more like the real Seer.\n- Thus, I side with Player 2. I believe Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, and Player 9 is a werewolf pretending to be the Guard.\n- Probability ranking of werewolves: Player 6 = Player 9 > Player 1 = Player 3 = Player 5 > Player 7\n\n# In conclusion, voting for Player 6 is the best choice for this round.",

Player 2's speech is relatively simple, without assigning tasks, directly giving a good identity to a later position player. The credibility is moderate.\n- **Player 6**: Declares player 8 as a bad identity. Player 6 gives player 8 a bad identity after player 2 declared them as good. Player 8 then claims to be a guard, while player 9 also claims to be a guard. This indicates that either player 8 or 9 must be a werewolf, making player 6's bad identity claim very strong.\nIn conclusion, I believe player 6 is the real seer, and we'll base our judgments on this.\n\n# Identity Assessments Based on the Seer's Information:\n- **Player 2**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer, opposing player 8.\n- **Player 8**: Identified as a bad identity by player 6, and claiming to be a guard against player 9. Highly likely to be a werewolf pretending to be a guard.\n- **Player 9**: Possibly the real guard.\n\n# Werewolf Probability Ranking:\n- 2 > 8 > 6 > 9\n- Even so, we can't be 100% certain that player 8 is a werewolf.
