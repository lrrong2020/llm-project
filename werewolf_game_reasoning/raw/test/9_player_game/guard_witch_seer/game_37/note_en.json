I trust Player 6 as the Witch, Player 8 as good, Player 3 as saved, and suggest the last werewolf is either Player 5 or 7. I believe Player 4 is a werewolf because the supposed Seer (Player 1) said Player 7 is good, but Player 4's perspective suggests either Player 5 or 7 could be a werewolf, which is inconsistent.\n- **Player 5**: I claim to be the Witch and say Player 1 was the target.
