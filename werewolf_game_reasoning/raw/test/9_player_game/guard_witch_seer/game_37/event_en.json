After hearing Player 7's speech, I believe they are at least a civilian or a higher role because their viewpoint aligns with mine. Player 7 analyzed that if Player 6 were a werewolf, giving Player 3 the saved status would have little benefit. I think this shows Player 7's good perspective. I'm not the seer, so I'll wait for the seer in the later positions to report their verification. Currently, based on the logic that Player 6 is the witch, Player 7 seems to be a good role, and Player 3 is good as the saved target, and knowing my own identity, I'm now focusing on Players 4 and 5. I believe there are 1 to 2 werewolves among Players 4 and 5. Among Players 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9, excluding one seer, we're left with a situation where 3 out of the remaining 4 players are werewolves. This is my current line of thinking. I'll analyze any other issues after hearing from the players in later positions.",

I hope the good people will trust me and vote to eliminate Number 4 today. If someone else claims to be the Seer, then from my perspective, two werewolves have appeared, which is also advantageous for the good team in the upcoming rounds. Number 6, who spoke earlier, was the first to claim to be the Witch and reported Number 3 as saved. I believe Number 6 is likely the real Witch because if they weren't, they would have certainly been poisoned last night. Number 7's speech was rather vague but didn't show any werewolf behavior; they might be a villager laying low or a werewolf. Number 8's logic seems very much like a good person because they're speaking from a good person's perspective, helping to find werewolves, while also challenging my claim about Number 4 being a bad identity.

Last night, I verified that No. 2 is a werewolf, and No. 9 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against me. This significantly reduces the pressure on me as the real Seer. I just need to carefully find the last werewolf, and we, the good team, will achieve a complete victory. I checked No. 2 because they were close to me. If they had been a good identity, No. 2 would have been like my second brain, helping me analyze the situation and assisting the good team in finding the werewolves. Unfortunately, I caught a werewolf, so I can only say to No. 2: I'm sorry, but you'll be eliminated this round. I believe No. 6 is the Witch because if No. 6 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to be the Witch in an early position. In this situation, the real Witch doesn't even need to reveal themselves during the day and could simply poison No. 6 at night. So, No. 6 can only be the real Witch. No. 7's speech was standard, only analyzing the earlier Witch claim from No. 6, so I can't define No. 7's identity. No. 8's perspective and logic are consistent with a good person's viewpoint, so I believe No. 8 has a good identity. I trust that the good people on the field can distinguish that I am the Seer! This round, vote to eliminate No. 2, and at night, the Witch should poison No. 9. During the night, I will also verify based on the voting pattern, although who I check is no longer important because the Witch has no more antidote, and I certainly won't survive until tomorrow's daytime.",

However, the good players in later positions might not be able to distinguish clearly, so I hope everyone can side with Player 9 after hearing my speech. Firstly, Player 9's claim of Player 4 being a bad identity has some credibility because Player 4 hasn't spoken yet. If Player 9 were a werewolf, they could have given a good identity to their werewolf teammate or a bad identity to a player in an earlier position who has already spoken, which would make it easier to vote for a good player to be eliminated. Secondly, Player 9 defended Player 8. Although I also believe Player 8 is good, Player 9 taking the risk to defend Player 8 without Player 8 indicating their allegiance is risky. Only a seer would defend a good player without considering the risks, while werewolves always consider the benefits when defending someone. If Player 9 were a werewolf, this would undoubtedly limit their werewolf teammates' survival space and might not necessarily gain votes from good players. Lastly, Player 9 stated they would verify me, Player 2, tonight, and if I pretend to be a seer, they would verify Player 1 instead. Clearly, Player 9 and I haven't met, so how could Player 1 possibly attack Player 2 and claim that Player 9 and I are both werewolves? I won't discuss the other players for now. I hope everyone can choose the right side and vote to eliminate Player 4, the werewolf identified by the seer, through a public vote.",

            "context": "Player 6, who spoke first, claimed to be the witch and reported me as their silver water. As my identity card is a good person, from my perspective, it doesn't make sense for Player 6 to be a werewolf pretending to be the witch, because if Player 6 were a werewolf, giving me, a good person, silver water status wouldn't benefit the werewolf team. So, in my eyes, Player 6 is likely the real witch.\n\nPlayer 7, who spoke second, had clear logic, believing that it's not beneficial for werewolves to pretend to be the witch, so Player 7 should be a good person.\n\nPlayer 8's speech was also fine, with a perspective similar to mine, and like me, they also thought Player 7 seemed good, so I believe Player 8 is also a good person.\n\nPlayer 9 claimed to be the seer and declared Player 4 as a bad identity. With five players yet to speak after them, I don't think they're trying to bluff a seer in the later positions. Moreover, if Player 9 were a werewolf pretending to be the seer, it would be easier to get a good person voted out by declaring a bad identity for a player who has already spoken. Also, Player 9 mentioned wanting to check either Player 2 or Player 1 who haven't claimed any role yet, which I think shows good insight. So, I believe Player 9 is the seer.\n\nPlayer 1 stood up claiming to be the seer and declared Player 2 as a bad identity. However, Player 1 considered Player 8 to be a logical good person, while Player 8 supported Player 7, thinking Player 7 seemed like a good person. But Player 1 didn't confirm Player 7's identity, only saying they wouldn't define it. Also, Player 7 was the first to accept Player 6's witch identity. So logically, I still think Player 9 is more likely to be the seer. Behaviorally, Player 1 claiming to be the seer without mentioning who they would check at night, and believing they would definitely be eliminated, thinking the guard wouldn't protect them, doesn't sound like a seer's speech to me.\n\nI believe Player 2's speech is that of a good person. If Player 1 were the seer, and Players 2 and 9 were werewolf teammates, it would have been more convincing for Player 9 to declare Player 2 (who hasn't spoken yet) as a good identity. This would appear more like a seer to the players in the outer positions, as Player 9 wouldn't fear Player 2 contradicting them during the police stage.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 9 is the real seer, Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the seer, Player 2 who accepted Player 1's bad identity declaration is actually a good person (reverse good identity), I myself am a good person and the first night's silver water, Players 7 and 8 are good people in my opinion, Player 6 is the witch. So in my eyes, the three werewolves are Players 1, 4, and 5.\n\nToday, I will side with Player 9 as the seer and vote out Player 4 who was declared as a bad identity. Since Players 4 and 5 after me are werewolves in my view, I will vote for Player 4 as declared by Player 9. I urge other good people to join me in voting out Player 4, the werewolf.",

            "context": "I am a villager card without self-protection ability, and I received a bad identity from player 9. Now it's known that players 1 and 9 both claim to be the seer. From my perspective, player 1 is definitely the real seer, and player 9 is pretending to be a seer, because I received a bad identity from player 9. I want to communicate with the good team that this round is not for eliminating either of the two seers, but definitely for choosing between players 2 and 4 to vote out. We should vote for one of them this round and see how the situation unfolds tomorrow.\n\nPlayer 2's speech is clearly a werewolf's mistake in my opinion. Both players 1 and 9 gave bad identities to players who haven't spoken yet, but you, player 2, said that player 9's bad identity for player 4, who hasn't spoken, carries more weight. Doesn't player 1's bad identity for you, player 2, who also hasn't spoken, carry equal weight? You, player 2, said that if player 9 were a werewolf, they could give a good identity to their werewolf teammate or a bad identity to a player who has already spoken. Why don't you apply the same logic to player 1, who also claims to be the seer? You, player 2, said that player 9 protected player 8. From your perspective, do you think werewolves only protect other werewolves? Player 8 is one of the best-performing players besides player 6 in my opinion. Shouldn't we protect such a player instead of waiting for them to make a mistake?\n\nFrom everyone's perspective, apart from me (player 4), where is player 1's werewolf teammate? This is a setup with a seer, a witch, and a guard. Tonight, the guard must protect this definite witch. The witch shouldn't use the poison tonight, but wait to see the seer's speech tomorrow. Because among these two seers, one must be a werewolf, and the werewolves definitely won't dare to kill either of the seer cards tonight. If they do, the other player claiming to be the seer would definitely be exposed as pretending to be a seer. If the fake seer decides to kill one of their own tonight to gain the trust of the good team, we can accept that too, as it reduces the number of werewolves.\n\nIf I'm eliminated this round, I advise everyone: Even if a seer is killed tomorrow, listen to and analyze the speech of the other seer before making a decision, because the fake seer might kill one of their own at night.\n\nFinally, as a villager, I'll share my judgments based on the speaking order. Player 6 is definitely the witch, as discussed earlier. I'm neutral about player 7's identity. Player 8's identity is the second most certain after the witch. I believe player 9 is a werewolf and player 1 is the seer. Player 2 has received a bad identity. Player 3 knows their own identity; you're the witch's save, so even if you attack me, I still consider you as part of the good team. So the last werewolf is either player 5 or 7. Since player 5 hasn't spoken yet, I won't conclude this round, but you, player 1 (the seer), definitely can't be killed tonight. Tonight you can only check either player 5 or 7. We'll discuss other things tomorrow. As a villager, I won't strongly suggest who to vote for, but this round we should definitely vote between players 2 and 4.",

            "context": "I am player 5, and I am the real Witch. Last night, player 1 was attacked, and I saved them. I believe I most likely saved the real Seer. Player 1's speech was comprehensive and logical, although they didn't analyze the werewolf suspects in detail. I can help analyze the werewolf suspects for player 1. First, player 1 blindly believed that player 6 was the Witch, so in player 1's logic, player 2 is their bad identity, while player 3 is player 6's saved player, likely a good guy. At the same time, player 1 thinks player 8 is good and player 9 is pretending to be the Seer. Player 4, as player 9's bad identity, can also be defined as good. So in player 1's view, the werewolf suspects are only players 2, 5, 7, and 9, with three werewolves among them. However, I am actually the real Witch, so the true werewolf suspects should be players 2, 6, and 9. I strongly disagree with player 1 putting me in the werewolf category without hearing any of my statements. Player 6, a werewolf in an early speaking position, claimed to be the Witch with a simple purpose: last night, player 1, the Seer, was attacked, and the werewolves feared they had killed the real Seer, potentially creating a situation with a saved Seer. Surprisingly, the werewolves guessed correctly, so player 6 pretended to be the Witch and claimed to have saved a good player in a later speaking position. As the real Witch, I was forced to reveal myself and report last night's true attack target. Player 6's intention in pretending to be the Witch was to make everyone mistakenly believe that player 6, a werewolf, is the real Witch, putting me, the real Witch, in a disadvantageous position among the werewolf suspects. So my current perspective is very clear: player 1 is the real Seer, players 2, 6, and 9 are the three werewolves. Today, we good players should first vote out player 2, the werewolf identified by player 1 the Seer. Tonight, I will use my poison to eliminate player 6, the werewolf pretending to be the Witch. Tomorrow, we good players will vote out player 9, the werewolf pretending to be the Seer. The Guard should remember to protect player 1, the Seer, tonight. The game will end, and the good team will win!",

So from Player 1's perspective, after excluding themselves and Player 9 (who they see as pretending to be a Seer), they should define the identities of Players 2, 4, and 5. However, Player 1 didn't provide an answer. Therefore, I believe Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be a Seer to protect their werewolf teammate, Player 4, and is not the real Seer. Consequently, Player 9, who is also claiming to be the Seer, is likely the true Seer.\n\n- **Player 2**: Their performance isn't very good, but compared to Player 4's performance, Player 2 is better. Tonight, Seer 9 should verify Player 2, so we'll see the results tomorrow morning.\n\n- **Player 3**: A player saved by the Witch.\n\n- **Player 4**: I believe they are the bad identity identified by the Seer.\n\n- **Player 5**: Claims to be the Witch. We'll assess the situation tomorrow morning; the real and fake Witches will resolve their conflict.\n\n- **Player 6**: First to claim the Witch role.\n\n- **Player 7**: Their analysis logic is similar to mine, and based on intuition, they seem to have a good identity.\n\n- **Player 9**: Player 9's speech demonstrates the perspective of a Seer and is also helping to provide insights for the good players in the outer positions who don't have night actions.\n\n# Probability ranking of werewolves:\n- 4=1>5>2\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 4.",

They believe player 6 in the earlier position is the witch, and players 7 and 8 who have spoken are good. They plan to verify player 2's identity tonight, stating they'll check player 1 if player 2 claims to be the seer. Player 9's speech aligns with a seer's perspective, matching my view. If player 9 were a werewolf and player 1 the real seer, then players 2 and 9 would be werewolves. In that case, there'd be no need to give a bad identity to a player who hasn't spoken; they could have given player 2, their werewolf teammate, a good identity to make people think player 9 gave a good identity to a player who hasn't spoken, without fear of player 2 opposing them. Also, player 9 wanting to verify player 2's identity tonight and worrying about player 2 pretending to be a seer indicates they don't meet at night, so they can't both be werewolves. Therefore, I believe player 9 is the real seer.\n\n- **Player 1**: Player 1 claimed to be the seer and gave player 2 a bad identity, saying players 2 and 9 are both werewolves. Player 1 believes player 8's earlier speech definitely indicates a good role, but is uncertain about player 7, even though player 8 vouched for player 7 as good. Player 1 accepts the widely acknowledged good player 8, but doesn't consider player 7 as good, so I think player 1's logic is flawed and seems to be trying to gain favor by protecting player 8 while leaving player 7's identity undefined to create survival space for the werewolf team. Moreover, player 9's intention to verify player 2's identity shows that players 2 and 9 don't meet at night, so player 1's logic that players 2 and 9 are both werewolves is incorrect. Therefore, I believe player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 9 is the real seer, and based on this, we make our judgments.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 1**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 9.\n- **Player 4**: Definitely a werewolf, as player 9 gave them a bad identity.\n- **Player 5**: Highly likely to be a werewolf.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- Player 1 > Player 4 > Player 5\n\nBased on the above, I decide to vote for player 5.",

If player 5 were the Witch, they wouldn't have failed to use the poison. If there was an unclaimed Witch in an earlier position, player 6 wouldn't still be alive today. So player 5 must have been a werewolf, probably poisoned by the real Witch last night. The fact that only player 5 died suggests the Guard successfully protected the werewolves' target. In the previous round, player 5 claimed to be the Witch in the last position and called for votes against player 1, so player 5 was likely player 1's werewolf teammate, not player 9's. This means player 9 is the real Seer. Last round, my opinion aligned with player 2's, but player 4 said player 2's speech revealed them as a werewolf, without saying the same about my speech. Player 4 didn't analyze whether I could be a werewolf who killed their teammate, and just assumed I was good. They also didn't strongly advocate voting for player 2, whom they believed was identified as a werewolf by player 1 (whom they considered the Seer), instead letting everyone vote freely. I don't think a good player would show such a lack of survival instinct, so I believe player 4 is a werewolf. That's why I voted for player 4 last round. Looking at last round's voting pattern, players 1, 4, and 5 voted for player 2 yesterday. I think it was three werewolves openly pushing for a vote, so my suspicions yesterday weren't wrong. The werewolves are players 1, 4, and 5. Today, only player 1 remains as a werewolf, so I will vote for player 1. I believe if player 1 is eliminated, the game will likely end. The players after me haven't heard updated speeches yet, so let's listen to the later positions and hear player 9, the Seer, report on last night's check. That's all from me.",

            "context": "Player 1 claimed to be the seer last round, declaring Player 2 as a bad identity and even saying \"sorry, you'll be eliminated\" to Player 2. From my perspective as a player without night actions, Player 1's behavior of wanting to eliminate Player 2 while also talking to them is very puzzling. Moreover, you didn't comment on Player 9's claim to be the seer, which was made earlier. How can the good players in later positions support you? Player 1 claims that it doesn't matter who they verified anymore because the witch has no potion left, but there's a guard in this setup, so why not let the guard protect you? Player 1 believes Player 8 is good because their perspective and logic are consistent with a good player's viewpoint. Player 1 also acknowledges that I'm good, but in the previous round, I mentioned that among Players 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9, one is a seer, and out of the remaining four cards, three are werewolves. So from Player 1's perspective, excluding themselves and Player 9 who they see as pretending to be the seer, how should they define the identity of Player 4, who was declared bad by Player 9? Player 1 didn't answer this, so I believe Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the seer to protect their teammate, Player 4, and is not the real seer.\n\nPlayer 4 talked a lot about judging true and false seers in the last round. Player 4, you've been declared as a bad identity, so no matter how much you say, it won't help. Since you've accepted being declared bad, the Player 9 who declared you must be the werewolf pretending to be the seer. What you need to do is to prove your innocence, not teach the good players in later positions who to support. Player 4 claims that Player 9 is the werewolf in their opinion, and Player 1 is the seer they believe in. This statement has already exposed them as a werewolf. Player 4, if you're clear about your own identity, wouldn't Player 9 definitely be the werewolf in your view, and Player 1 definitely be your ultimate seer? Similarly, if you're clear that you're a good player, and Player 1 is the real seer, and Player 2 is the bad identity declared by the real seer in your view, then you should definitely vote for Player 2, instead of letting everyone choose between Players 2 and 4 to eliminate. This is where Player 4 made mistakes during their speech!\n\nBased on the above analysis, Player 9 is the real seer, which is also why I supported eliminating Player 4 in the last round. Player 5, in the last position, claimed to be the witch. From my perspective, it seems like Player 5 only claimed to be the witch after hearing other players' speeches and feeling that their werewolf teammate was about to be eliminated, in an attempt to save their werewolf companion. However, regardless of whether Player 5 is the real witch or not, the two true and false witches will resolve the situation at night.\n\nI am the guard. Last night I protected Player 6, resulting in a peaceful night. On the first night, I chose not to protect anyone. So far, only Player 5, who was poisoned by the witch, has died. To be honest, when Player 5 claimed to be the witch yesterday, I found it ridiculous. Between Players 1 and 9, one of the true and false seers is a werewolf. Among the bad identities declared by the two true and false seers, one must be a werewolf. Then, between the two true and false witches, one is a werewolf, and at night the two true and false witches will use their poison to prove their identities. Therefore, Players 3, 7, and 8 in the later positions must be good players. I actually wanted to protect myself last night because I was afraid of dying, but after much consideration, I still chose to protect Player 6.\n\nLast night's attack was on Player 6, which means Player 6 is the real witch, and Player 5 was a werewolf pretending to be the witch. Player 9 is the real seer, so Player 4 is truly a bad identity. We now have 3 special roles and 3 villagers left, with Player 1 being the last werewolf pretending to be a special role. I vote to eliminate Player 1 today.",

Yesterday, player 5 pretended to be the witch in the last position and called for votes for player 1, clearly being player 1's werewolf teammate, so player 9 is the real seer.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to have checked player 3 as a good identity, but player 1 already considered player 3 to be a good role yesterday, and player 3 is the witch's saved target. Player 1 had no reason to check player 3 last night.
