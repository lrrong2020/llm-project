If a werewolf were to make such a bold claim, wouldn't it be like a \"suicidal\" pretense? So this gives Player 5 some credibility as a Seer. Despite saying all this, I still reserve judgment on whether Player 5 is actually the Seer. I need to hear the counter-claims from the players in later positions before making a decision. If Player 5 is indeed the Seer, I suggest the werewolves don't make any claims, and we should all vote freely. If Player 5 is a werewolf, I recommend their werewolf teammates in later positions to make a supplementary claim, as Player 5's current claim won't convince any good players. Regarding Player 6's comments, I hope you can think more critically. Just because the Seer didn't verify anyone on the first night doesn't mean they should be eliminated. I don't want to hear players in later positions expressing the same opinion as Player 6. I hope the good players will analyze the logic more thoroughly and make more substantial speeches instead of being passive.

To help the good guys distinguish between real and fake seers, I'll explain why I'm definitely not a werewolf. First, if No. 5 were my werewolf teammate and I was pretending to be a seer to support them, I would have randomly accused someone of being a werewolf to divert suspicion, rather than admitting I didn't verify anyone. Second, if No. 5 is the real seer and I'm pretending to be one, saying I didn't verify anyone offers no benefit. Therefore, I'm certainly not a werewolf, and I'm definitely not on the same team as No. 5. This proves I'm a good guy.\n\nWhen No. 5 claimed to be the seer and said they didn't verify anyone, I was tempted to immediately accuse them of being a werewolf. However, I needed to respect my role as the true seer. I genuinely didn't verify anyone last night, and I can't falsely accuse No. 5 in good conscience. Nevertheless, No. 5 is indeed pretending to be the seer.\n\nI believe a good person wouldn't claim to be the seer when two others have already done so, as it would only confuse the good team. So, if anyone else claims to be the seer, then among No. 5, No. 9, and the third claimant, there must be two werewolves. In that case, I'd be willing to be eliminated along with No. 5 and the third claimant, as I believe sacrificing myself as the seer to eliminate two werewolves would be worthwhile.\n\nIf the witch doesn't trust me, you can vote to eliminate No. 5 today and use the poison on me tonight. However, if I survive, I will definitely verify someone tonight based on today's voting patterns. As Seer No. 9, I'm calling for votes against No. 5.",

The disadvantage is that if I cast a different vote when the witch is calling for votes on Player 5, it could easily expose my werewolf identity, which is unfavorable for my survival in the later stages.\n- **Voting for Player 5**: The disadvantage is that voting out my werewolf teammate is unfavorable for the werewolves' survival in the later stages and will put the werewolf team at a disadvantage. The advantage is that by following the real witch's vote, I'm less likely to be suspected and can more easily disguise myself as a villager.\nIn conclusion, if Player 9 is voted out, it would be more beneficial for the werewolf faction.

It seemed more like an open-eyed werewolf's view, so I voted for No. 9. Today, I'm watching No. 5's verification report. If No. 5's speech is unsatisfactory and their verification doesn't convince me, I will vote for No. 5. After all, No. 5 and No. 9 both claimed to be the Seer, and neither provided a verification on the first day, so their credibility is almost the same. I believe No. 7's speech aligns with No. 9's. No. 7 said, \"I suggest that the werewolf companion in the later positions should make a supplementary claim for No. 5, as No. 5's current claim won't deceive the good guys.\" This seems like a hint to the werewolves in later positions to make a supplementary claim.

Since Player 9 was voted out by a large margin, they were probably the Seer. Therefore, this round I'm voting to eliminate Player 5, who I believe is pretending to be a Seer.\n\nI'm the Guard. Last night, I protected Player 2, the Witch. Although Player 2 claimed to be the Witch without mentioning any saved players, I wasn't entirely convinced at the time. However, besides Player 2, I really didn't know who else to protect, as there seemed to be no other worthy candidates, so I was forced to guard Player 2. Since we had a peaceful night, it proves that you, Player 2, are indeed the real Witch.\n\nAddressing Player 2: You can use your poison tonight.\n\nPlayer 1's speech yesterday lacked any thoughtful analysis, so Players 1 and 5 are likely the two werewolves.

First, No. 9 already made mistakes during his speech yesterday, saying \"No. 9 is the Seer, didn't verify anyone last night. The reason was to do something unexpected.\" Is that really the only reason you didn't verify anyone, just to be unpredictable? This is not the mindset a Seer should have! As a Seer, if you forget to verify someone, I believe you should do as I did - apologize to all the good players, ask for everyone's understanding and forgiveness, rather than \"intentionally\" or even \"deliberately\" not verifying anyone. Such an attitude definitely doesn't fit a Seer! Therefore, I can accept the votes from No. 1, 3, 5, and 6 who voted for No. 9 as a werewolf pretending to be a Seer yesterday. After all, you all helped me vote out the fake Seer. I hope you can continue to support me this round! Yesterday, No. 7's speech was very strange: \"If No. 5 is really the Seer, then I suggest the werewolves shouldn't pretend to be the Seer, let's just vote freely.\" Why would you want the werewolves not to pretend to be the Seer? If the werewolves don't pretend, how can we clearly identify them? So I verified No. 7 last night, and No. 7 is indeed a werewolf! Today, please everyone vote for No. 7, this werewolf pretending to be a Guard. Tonight, No. 3 Guard, please protect me. Tomorrow I will bring you new verification information and lead us good people to victory!",

Therefore, I believe Player 5's action of giving Player 7 a bad identity aligns with my psychological expectations of a seer. Player 5 seems more likely to be the seer.\n- **Player 9**: After claiming to be the seer, Player 9 still thought there would be a third person claiming to be the seer, which doesn't align with my psychological expectations of a seer. I believe Player 9 lacks the seer's perspective and is more likely to be a werewolf pretending to be a seer.\n\n# Identity judgment based on my belief that Player 5 is the seer:\n- Since Player 5 is the seer, and Player 5 declared Player 7 as a bad identity, Player 7 must be a werewolf.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe voting for Player 7 is the better choice this round.",
