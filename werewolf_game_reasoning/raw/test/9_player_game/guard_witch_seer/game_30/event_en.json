Player 1 believes that either Player 8 or 9, who are already out, was the Witch. Player 2 claims to be the Seer and declares Player 1 as a good identity, saying they can't define the roles of Players 6 and 7 yet. Given that I know I'm a Villager, there must be a werewolf among Players 6, 7, and 1. I think Players 1 and 2 might be a werewolf pair, and I want to side with the Seer who will claim the role later! I believe Player 1 might have inside information, and Player 2 is trying to protect Player 1. So, the eliminated Players 8 and 9 should be a Werewolf and the Witch - this is the perspective Player 1 is selling to me. I want to vote for Player 2 as a werewolf!

Player 4 is pretending to be the Witch and siding with player 2, who is pretending to be the Seer. I urge the good team not to believe player 4's claim of being the Witch! Player 4's speech is self-contradictory, first saying player 9 is a werewolf who killed themselves, then claiming player 9 is good. I believe either player 8 or 9 could be the Witch who was killed by the werewolves. I suggest that if the Witch is targeted, it's best to use the potion to save themselves, as the probability of poisoning a werewolf from an outer position when killed is only 3/8. Analyzing the earlier speeches: I think player 6 seems good, as their criticism of the Witch's actions appears to be considering the pros and cons for the good team. Player 7 copied player 6's speech and also claimed to be a villager like player 6, so I think player 7 might be a werewolf following player 6's lead. I believe that if players 1 and 2 were on the same team, it would have been more convincing for player 1 to claim to be the Seer and verify player 2 as good in an earlier position. So, player 2 pretending to be the Seer and verifying player 1 as good is likely trying to get player 1's vote. Player 3 thinks player 2 is a werewolf and sides with the Seer who spoke later, so player 3 is likely good. However, I want to address player 3: I think players 1 and 2 might not be on the same team, though of course, everyone may have different ways of thinking. I ask the Guard to protect me tonight so I can report another identity check. Tonight, I will check player 7's identity. For this round, I call for votes against player 4, who I've identified as a werewolf!",

Player 3 voted for Player 2 on the first day, but I don't think Player 3's behavior looks like vote splitting.\n- On the first day, Player 3 stated that Players 1 and 2 were two werewolves, and directly called for voting Player 1 out. Therefore, Players 2 and 3 are likely not in communication with each other.\n- Player 2's logic for checking players is problematic. If Player 2 were the real Seer, then Player 5 would definitely be a werewolf pretending to be a Seer against Player 2. Thus, Player 2 shouldn't have checked Player 5.\nAlthough Player 2's player-checking lacks logic, I believe Players 2 and 3 are not in communication. As a villager, I can't accurately judge whether Player 2 or Player 5 is the real Seer, but I must cast this vote, otherwise, the good team will directly lose.\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 5.",
