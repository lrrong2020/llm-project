Player 1 claimed to be the seer, but their speech was only ten words long, which is extremely brief. If you're the seer, how can you expect the good team to find you with such a short statement? If the good team can't find you, are you really helping them? Perhaps Player 1's attitude is \"I've already found a werewolf, so my job as a seer is done. You can believe me or not.\" In any case, I'm extremely dissatisfied with Player 1's speech!\n\nPlayer 2 stood up to test identities, made a joke, and seemed quite relaxed. I think they're more likely to be on the good side. Player 3's speech was clearly more substantial than Player 1's, showing the mindset and thought process of a seer. Their speaking style was much better than Player 1's. However, Player 3's statement \"I hope the good team doesn't just consider the strength of the claims, as strength alone doesn't prove anything\" is like using their own spear to strike their own shield. If Player 1 is a werewolf, the probability of them correctly identifying a real seer as a bad identity is indeed low, which is the only point that could make Player 1 a possible seer!\n\nAddressing Player 4, the witch, I hope you'll listen to everyone's speeches before choosing sides. Don't rush to call for votes, or you might end up being the werewolf team's greatest ally. Have you clearly explained your reasons for siding with Player 1? You said, \"If anyone dares to vote out Player 1, I won't hesitate to use my poison on them.\" Well, I'm a rebellious good player, and I'm going to reserve your poison right now by siding with Player 3!

Secondly, player 3 only mentioned that player 2 might be good, without referring to any of the players in later positions. I think player 3's speech doesn't sound like a seer looking for werewolves, but rather like someone forced to pretend to be a seer after being accused. Moreover, player 4, claiming to be the witch, is strongly leading the vote against player 3 this round. Surprisingly, player 5 is asking the witch to use the poison on them, which is a request I've never heard before! Player 5 doesn't doubt at all whether player 4 might be a werewolf pretending to be the witch to make the good guys support player 1, indicating that in player 5's view, player 4 is good. So the witch's job is made easier; since player 5 has already made such an \"excessive\" request, player 4 might as well grant it. As a villager with no night actions, I'll definitely follow the witch's plan and vote for player 3 this round.",

Moreover, No. 5 pointed out that No. 3's statement \"I hope the good people don't just consider the credibility issue, as credibility alone doesn't prove anything\" was inappropriate. No. 5 also analyzed the possibility of No. 1 being the real seer. Although No. 5 figured out these two points, they still chose to support No. 3, which I don't understand. However, No. 8's speech had a sense of schadenfreude. No. 8 deduced that No. 5 might be a villager, yet still encouraged the witch to poison No. 5.

Player 2 doesn't seem to be a werewolf.\n- I believe that if player 1 is pretending to be a seer, and assuming player 2 is not a werewolf, the probability of player 1 accurately giving player 3 (the real seer) a bad identity is relatively low.\n- Moreover, player 4 claims to be the witch and strongly supports player 1.\n- Player 7, who received a good identity from player 3, switches sides to support player 1.\n- I believe the players supporting player 7 are all good people.\nBased on the above, I think player 1 is the real seer, and we'll make judgments based on this.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- Player 3: Is a werewolf competing with player 1 for the seer role.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 3.",
