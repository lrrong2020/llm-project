Also, Player 4's analysis that Player 8 might be the witch aligns with my thoughts. I also believe that the double death of Players 7 and 8 suggests one of them was likely a witch who was killed. The speech from Player 2 in the front position was only eight words long, making it impossible to define their identity. Player 3 said, \"Please, seer, speak carefully. I will try my best to find you.\" I think Player 3 seems more like a good person, as they are at least trying to find the seer. Let's see if anyone in the back positions claims to be the seer.

If Player 4 were pretending to be a Seer, they would have had information and could have easily declared a bad or good identity for a player in a later position. There's no need to declare a dead player as good, as it carries no weight. Player 6 is clearly pretending to be a Seer who checks identities during the day, but how can a real Seer not have any thought process when checking? I believe Player 3 is being portrayed as a good role by Player 6. If Player 5 votes with Player 6 today, then Seer 4 can directly check Player 5's identity.

If you, No. 4, were really the seer, why weren't you eliminated last night? Would the werewolves let you live to continue reporting your verifications? The fact that you, No. 4, are still alive is the best proof of your werewolf identity. It's irrefutable evidence. With a simple analysis, we can know that No. 4 must be a werewolf! Yesterday, I reluctantly said I temporarily sided with you, No. 4, because I hadn't heard the seer's speech from the later positions. No. 6's speech was powerful and hit the nail on the head. No. 6 is the true seer in my heart. Please, No. 4, don't flatter yourself! The reason I didn't vote for No. 9 yesterday was that I felt No. 4's speech was far from convincing as a seer. I was so eager to eliminate No. 4, this werewolf pretending to be a seer, that I even forgot to vote for No. 9, the bad identity! Now the situation is very clear. No. 4 and No. 9 are both werewolves. I believe that among No. 7 and No. 8, who were eliminated on the first day, one was the witch and one was a werewolf. Otherwise, we would already have three werewolves controlling the game, and they wouldn't need to put on this act for us. I'm talking to No. 1 and No. 2, the villagers. I urge you to turn back while you can. Please don't follow the werewolves into the dark abyss. Follow me and let's vote out No. 4, the werewolf pretending to be a seer, first.
