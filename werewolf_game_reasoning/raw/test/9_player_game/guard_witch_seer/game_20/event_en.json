However, now that Player 9 hasn't claimed any role and spoke briefly, I believe this isn't typical good player behavior. Therefore, I suspect Player 9 might be a werewolf. Player 1 checked Player 3 and found them to be a werewolf. I have a favorable impression of Player 1 because they identified Player 3 as a bad identity, skipping over me. If we rule out the possibility of Players 1 and 3 being a werewolf pair, then Player 1's credibility is quite strong.

I admit that in terms of credibility, I'm indeed not as strong as Player 1. So, I can only try my best through my speech to prove to my fellow good players that I'm the real Seer. I hope you won't easily take sides based solely on the credibility issue.\n\nFirstly, Player 1's speech isn't flawless. What kind of distorted perspective would make you consider the issue of both the Guard and the Witch protecting the same person? When I saw the information about Player 7's death, my first thought was that the Witch didn't save anyone, so your revealed perspective is unnecessary.\n\nSecondly, from Player 1's perspective, Player 9 stood up to speak for a long time but only said 13 words. If you were really the Seer, how could you possibly ignore this point? You didn't even mention Player 9 at all. How can you claim to be the Seer?\n\nI am the real Seer, and I hope my fellow good players can find me.

Let's see how the later positions speak before deciding on the vote. For now, I won't take sides. But I want to add something for Player 1: don't rashly assume that Player 7 being eliminated on the first night definitely means they're a good player. The fact that you can directly acknowledge them as good shows you have a bias towards saved players. You must face this issue.

Player 9's mere 13 words left me feeling helpless, but it's normal for the first speaker to have no information. So, player 2's accusation of player 9 is completely forced. Moreover, player 2 said, \"Player 1 skipped over me to declare player 3 as a bad identity. As a good player, this strongly suggests that player 1 is the Seer.\" This statement is significant because if player 2 were good, wouldn't player 1, as their werewolf teammate, have declared player 2 as a good identity to avoid exposing them? I define players 1 and 2 as werewolves, player 3 as the Seer, player 4 as a confirmed good player, and player 9 as a good player exposed by player 2's speech. Good players, don't take the wrong side.

However, we currently disagree on our stance. In my opinion, the method to distinguish the real Seer is to look at the strength of the early-position claims and the logic of the late-position claims. Player 5's statement, \"If Player 1 verified Player 3 as a good identity, then Player 2 would be directly placed in the werewolf pit by Player 1. How could Player 2 have a good impression of Player 1?\" This clearly contradicts objective facts and is a forced attack on Player 2. First of all, in this round, Player 1 identified Player 3 as a bad identity, forcing Player 3 to claim the Seer role. In their speech, they considered Player 1 to be a werewolf, but didn't mention Player 2 at all, who wanted to side with Player 1. Instead, they directly analyzed the relationship between Players 9 and 1, which is certainly unreasonable. So, Player 6, don't claim my identity to side with the werewolves. Just focus on your job and protect Seer Player 1 tonight. For now, I can only conclude that Players 3 and 5 are two werewolves, with the third possibly being either Player 4 or 9. I will use my poison on Player 5 tonight, and the Seer should verify either Player 4 or 9. This round, I vote for werewolf Player 3.",

Player 3's immediate claim to be the seer after receiving player 1's bad identity declaration significantly increases the likelihood of player 1 being the real seer.

Possibly a good person.\n- **Player 5**: A werewolf siding with player 1, forcefully accusing player 2 of being a werewolf in their speech, this behavior is seeking a target to vote for.\n- **Player 6**: Claims to be the Witch, but their actual identity can only be the Guard, not a werewolf. Because player 6 reported that player 7 was eliminated due to both being protected and saved, so their purpose is to shield me from being killed.\n- **Player 9**: Speech was too brief, unable to determine their identity as good or werewolf based on their speech for now.\n# Werewolf possibility ranking: 3>5>9>4>2>1=6\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 3.",

But after I finished speaking, I reconsidered carefully. The guard indeed has no reason to pretend to be the witch and take the hit for her, as the guard is even more afraid of being eliminated than the witch. Let's listen to player 1's verification result. If they reveal a good identity, then the other two players should be eliminated together.

Moreover, the real Witch, upon hearing a player in an earlier speaking position pretend to be the Witch and report night information, wouldn't consider that player to be good (the Guard).

I think it's unlikely for a guard to claim to be a witch as it risks being poisoned. Therefore, I believe player 6 is likely a werewolf.\n- Players 5 and 9 voted incorrectly in the last round.

This means player 7 is the werewolf who killed themselves on the first night.\n\n- Player 8 sided with player 1, pretended to be the witch, and voted for player 3.\n- Yesterday, both players 3 and 4 were eliminated. Player 8 stood up but didn't report last night's poison information, didn't analyze the situation for the good team, and still chose to side with player 1 without reason.\n- Based on this, I conclude that player 8 is not the real witch.\n\n# Judging from yesterday's voting pattern:\n- Player 4 sided with player 1 and voted for player 3.\n- And last night, both players 3 and 4 died.\n- Among the players in later positions, except for player 8 pretending to be the witch, no one else has claimed to be the witch.\n- Therefore, player 4 is likely the real witch who sided with the wrong team and poisoned player 3, the real seer.\n\n# Identity judgments based on the above information:\n- Player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the seer.\n- Player 2 is a villager who sided with the wrong team.\n- Player 3 was the real seer.\n- Player 4 was the witch.\n- Player 5 is a villager.\n- Player 6 is the guard.\n- Player 7 was the werewolf who killed themselves on the first night.\n- Player 8 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch.\n- I, player 9, am a villager.\n\n- **In conclusion, I choose to vote for player 1 first**, and then vote for player 8 tomorrow.",
