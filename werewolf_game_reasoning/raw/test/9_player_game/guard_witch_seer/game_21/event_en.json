The earlier speakers, players 4 and 5, made strange comments: \"Tonight is a peaceful night, which is great, although the Witch might have saved a werewolf.\" From a good player's perspective, shouldn't it be a self-inflicted wound by a werewolf? Moreover, player 5 completely copied player 4's speech, which is typical of a werewolf trying to blend in. So, in my view, we've identified three werewolves: players 3, 4, and 5. Today, we should vote to eliminate player 3. The Guard should protect me tonight, and the Witch should use the poison on either player 4 or 5. This way, we're guaranteed to eliminate two werewolves.",

Even if they were a werewolf, they might choose to be an aggressive werewolf instead of counter-claiming the Seer. Why do you assume the player who received the silver water is a counter-claiming werewolf? Overall, Player 4's speech logic doesn't sound like a good person, but rather like a werewolf with inside information! Player 5 didn't analyze Player 4's speech when they stood up, but instead followed Player 4's lead. I believe Player 5 is either a werewolf or a special role. If I were the Seer, I wouldn't even want to check Player 5; they should be eliminated tomorrow if they don't reveal their identity. Player 6 said they've identified Players 3, 4, and 5 as the three werewolves. Excellent! Player 6's speech aligns with my assessment of the earlier speakers, Players 4 and 5, as I believe both of their speeches indicate they are werewolves! Player 6 declared Player 3 as a bad identity. Although I'm unsure of Player 3's role, I think Player 6's comments on Players 4 and 5 match my thoughts exactly, so I'm siding with Player 6! Today, I'm voting for Player 3. I suggest the Witch doesn't use the poison tonight; as long as the Guard protects the right person, it should be fine. Tomorrow, Players 4 and 5 should be eliminated in that order!",

Setting aside that Player 5 is my good identity, Player 4's speech suggesting that the Witch might have saved a hook werewolf rather than a self-stabbed werewolf actually confirms that Player 4 doesn't have inside information and is a good identity. Additionally, Player 7 directly sided with Player 6, typically charging for their fellow werewolf 6, and Player 7's logic in attacking Players 4 and 5 is the same as Player 6's forceful attack. In a comprehensive analysis, Witch, if your saved player is Player 7, I hope you poison Player 7 as well, as 7 is definitely a charging werewolf. Player 8's viewpoint largely aligns with mine, but don't attack Player 5, as 5 is my good identity. Tonight, I will verify one of the later-positioned players, either Player 1 or 2. This round, let's vote to eliminate Player 6. I believe Players 3, 4, 5, and 8 will definitely vote with me to eliminate Player 6.

From my perspective, I'm more inclined to believe that player 6 is the real seer compared to player 9. Why? Because when player 4 stood up to speak first, why did they think the witch saved a bait werewolf instead of a self-stabbed werewolf? Moreover, I suspect player 5 has a high probability of being a werewolf from my point of view, because after player 4 finished speaking in the first position, player 5 used the same speech to muddle through. I don't think player 5 can claim to be a good character, which greatly diminishes the credibility of player 9's claim to be the seer. If we consider player 6 to be the seer, then we've already identified three werewolf cards: players 3, 5, and 9. However, we should still listen to player 3's speech for a comprehensive analysis. If player 3's speech is more substantial, I might reconsider and support player 9 instead.",

Player 6 claimed to be the seer and declared Player 3 as a bad identity. Player 7 sided with Player 6 and called for votes against Player 3. Player 8 sided with the seer in the back position and believed that Players 5, 6, and 7 are three consecutive werewolves. First, let's analyze Player 9. Player 9 claimed to be the seer and declared Player 5 as a good identity. Based on Player 6's attack on Players 4 and 5, Player 9 judged that both 4 and 5 are good people, and believed that Player 7 is Player 6's offensive werewolf teammate. Player 9 said they would check either Player 1 or 2 tonight and called for votes against Player 6. In summary, Player 9's view is: Player 6 is pretending to be a seer, Player 7 is an offensive werewolf, and the last werewolf is either Player 1 or 2. However, I don't understand what Player 9 meant by \"excluding your outer good identity cards doesn't count.\" I really can't comprehend it. I think this statement exposed that Player 9 has inside information and knows who the good players are. Analyzing Player 6 further, we now know that the werewolves identified by Player 6 are Players 3, 4, and 5. So I ask Player 6, how would you define Player 9, who claimed to be the seer in the back position? Player 6's speech decisively labeled Players 3, 4, and 5 as werewolves, without even giving them a chance to redeem themselves. I can't determine yet whether Player 6 or Player 9 is the real seer. I will focus on listening to Player 3's speech this round before choosing sides.",

Since there's a chance that No. 5 could be eliminated due to both the Guard and the Witch protecting them, this would allow me to match nighttime information with the Witch, thus confirming my identity as the Guard. If No. 6 were the real Seer, they wouldn't irresponsibly say \"all three wolves found\" because the players in later positions haven't spoken or taken sides yet. So No. 6 is likely pretending to be the Seer. This round, I'll pay close attention to No. 4's vote because No. 6, who's pretending to be the Seer, has already claimed that No. 4 and No. 5 are two wolves. We'll set aside the fact that No. 5 is the Seer's good identity for now. If No. 4 dares to vote for me this round, it's equivalent to admitting they're a werewolf. No. 7 is a werewolf supporting the fake Seer, actually believing No. 6's absurd \"all three wolves found\" theory! I suggest the Witch poison No. 7 tonight! I can't tolerate No. 7's speech anymore! A word to No. 8: if you're a good guy, there's no need to attack No. 5, because No. 5 has already been labeled as a wolf by No. 6, and No. 5 is the Seer's good identity! No. 1's speech suggests they might side with No. 6. If you're a good guy, please reconsider and don't fall into the wolf trap. If you're a werewolf, forget what I said. Let me analyze the logic for everyone: if No. 5 and No. 9 were both wolves, why would No. 5 copy No. 4's speech, and why would No. 9 give a good identity to someone with such a low-profile role? This can only mean that No. 9 is the real Seer, and their verification shows No. 5 is good! No. 2 hasn't taken a side yet, so I can't define their identity. Tonight, I will protect No. 9 to ensure they can safely report their verification information tomorrow. This round, I vote for No. 6, the werewolf.

If I vote for No.6 now, it would make the good players think my words and actions are inconsistent, making it easier to expose my werewolf identity. Additionally, if I vote for my werewolf companion No.6, it would increase the risk of No.6 being voted out.

The disadvantage is that we might lose a werewolf teammate, causing our werewolf team to fall behind in rounds.\n- Player 3, in the last speaking position, claimed to be the guard and called for votes against player 6. I judge that this might gain the trust of most good players on the field. If I rashly vote for player 9 at this point, not only would I fail to vote out the real seer, but I would also expose my own identity.\n\nConsidering all of this, I believe voting for player 6 is the better choice.",

This round, let's vote for Player 1, the werewolf, and have them eliminated along with their werewolf teammates, Players 6 and 7. I also want to praise the witch. The witch's role is very powerful and has good judgment, able to identify me, Player 9, as the real seer, and obediently poisoned Player 7. Now, about Player 3, the guard, who sacrificed themselves heroically to protect me. Player 3 is truly a role model for us good players! I also want to comment on Player 2. In the previous round, Player 2's speech was just beating around the bush, analyzing the logic of both sides for a long time, and finally saying they would focus on Player 3's speech. Player 2 might as well have simply said they couldn't distinguish the real seer and wouldn't choose a side. If the game doesn't end after voting out Player 1 this round, then the evasive Player 2 must be a werewolf.",

If 6 had only used this point against me, I would have accepted it, but 6 actually claimed that 3, 4, and 5 were three werewolves, which is absurdly illogical. How can you call yourself a seer if you're accusing other players of being werewolves without any verification? 3 claimed to be the guard last round, saying \"if 4 dares to vote for me this round, it's equivalent to admitting they're a werewolf.\" As a villager, why would I attack you? Moreover, even if I were a werewolf, with 6 and 7 as my werewolf teammates attacking me like this, wouldn't I be likely to backstab them? From my perspective, 6 and 7 must be a werewolf duo, with 7 rushing to support 6, not even waiting to hear from the later speakers! Today, it doesn't matter how eloquently 1 speaks. If you follow my lead as the almighty seer, we can vote out 1 unanimously, and the game will likely end. If it doesn't end, tomorrow I'll automatically go to the PK stage with 2!",

Although based on today's situation, Player 7 was likely wrongly poisoned, and Players 1 and 2 are probably the two werewolves. However, I can clarify the perspective for everyone. Player 3 was the only one who claimed to be the Guard on the first day, and the Witch certainly wouldn't dare to poison him. Player 3 also couldn't be a werewolf who killed himself, as the Witch has already used her healing potion in this game, so there's no benefit in doing so. Therefore, Player 3 is a genuine Guard who was targeted by the werewolves. Player 2 today is pretending to be the Guard, and I believe Player 2 can't possibly be a good person, pretending to be the Guard to avoid being killed. So from my perspective, Player 6 giving a bad identity to the real Guard (Player 3) makes Player 6 a werewolf. Player 9 is the real Seer, and Player 1 is Player 9's bad identity for this round.
