Without hearing from the later positions, I might choose to verify the identity of either Player 6 or 7. However, this doesn't necessarily mean my final verification choice. I will decide whom to verify after seeing this round's voting results. For this round, I suggest we all vote for the werewolf pretending to be a Seer in the later positions. Please don't split the votes! If the werewolf in the later position thinks my argument is strong, they might back down and not challenge my Seer claim. In that case, we should choose someone with a poor speech among those claiming to be villagers for a vote-off.
