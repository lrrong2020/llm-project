Player 7 immediately claimed to be a villager and sided with Player 5 before Player 2 even spoke, and also suspected Player 2 to be a werewolf. I believe Player 7 has inside information. This leads to two possible scenarios. First, Player 7 and Player 5 could be on the same team. Alternatively, Player 7's behavior might be undermining Player 5's credibility as a seer, suggesting that Player 7 could be a werewolf trying to frame Player 5 and get them eliminated. Player 8 hasn't taken a side yet, so their identity is unclear for now. Player 9, speaking later, claimed to be a seer and declared Player 6, whom I consider good, as having a bad identity. This makes Player 9's claim as a seer less convincing to me. Before hearing Player 2's speech, I'm tentatively siding with Player 5.",

This is because player 6 spoke second and didn't know if the good players in later positions would choose the right side. Therefore, it was unnecessary for player 6 to directly attack player 5 by saying \"I think this point is false logic\" - it neither establishes their own identity nor deceives more good players.

However, they don't mention player 6, who was declared bad by player 9.\n- Therefore, player 2's behavior seems more like a werewolf who knows their teammate 9 declared player 6 as good, automatically ignoring player 6's existence.\n- Player 6 thinks player 5's statement \"If I were a 'werewolf', it wouldn't be my turn to pretend to be a seer\" doesn't sound like a real seer.\n- If player 6 were player 5's werewolf teammate, there would be no need to attack player 5 after 5 claimed to be the seer.\n- Thus, player 6 is likely not player 5's werewolf teammate.\nBased on the above, I believe player 5 is the real seer, and we'll make judgments based on this.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer:\n- **Player 9**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 5.\n- **Player 2**: The werewolf identified by player 5.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 2 = 9 > 5\n\nI support voting for player 2, who was declared as bad identity by player 5, whom I believe to be the real seer.\n- In conclusion, I decide to vote for player 2.",

Today, Number 3, the guard, was also killed by the werewolves, and Number 8 dared to directly claim to be the guard.

The werewolves are now riding on the necks of the good people and jumping up to attack! If the good people don't turn back now, we're definitely going to lose. I want to emphasize one point: Number 2 being a werewolf has no direct logical connection to whether I'm the seer or not. The good people voting for Number 2 yesterday was completely fine, but today, as the only true seer in the game, I call on all good people to vote with me for Number 8, the verified werewolf!

But Number 2 received a bad identity check from Number 5 last round. If Number 2 were the Guard, they would have definitely claimed their identity to make the good team side with Number 9, but Number 2 didn't do this, so Number 2 is a werewolf. Number 2 voting for Number 3 is actually trying to make Number 5 look like the real Seer. Number 3 said they would vote for Number 2 yesterday, but ended up voting for Number 6, so Number 3's words and actions don't match. Number 8 also claimed to be the Guard today, with three players competing for one Guard role, indicating two of them are werewolves. I think the focus this round should be on the Witch's night information. If the Witch didn't use the poison, then Number 3 being killed at night proves they're the real Guard. If Number 3 was poisoned by the Witch for changing their vote, then Number 8 is likely the Guard, but Number 8 hasn't reported any protection information, which is why I'm skeptical about Number 8 being the Guard. This game is full of doubts. If Number 2 is really a villager who received a bad identity check, not only did they fail to confirm their identity, but they also didn't vote for the werewolf pretending to be the Seer and instead voted for the Guard. Number 2 should be held responsible for the good team's failure!",

The situation in this game is very clear: Numbers 2 and 3 are the two werewolves who have been eliminated, and currently, Number 9 is the only remaining werewolf on the field. Number 8 is the real guard. The reason Number 3 couldn't be the real guard is that on the first day, he called for votes against Number 2, but when the voting pattern came out, he voted for Number 6.

Moreover, Player 3 said they would vote for Player 2 yesterday but changed their vote to Player 6, and was then poisoned by the Witch.\n- I believe Player 3 was most likely a werewolf pretending to be the Guard, who was poisoned by the Witch.\n- Player 9 is the last remaining werewolf on the field.\n- In conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 9.",
