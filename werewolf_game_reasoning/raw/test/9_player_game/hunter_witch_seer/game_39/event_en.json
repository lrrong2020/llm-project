Therefore, I can confirm Player 5, who spoke earlier, as having a good identity. Tonight, I will verify Player 4's identity because their speech seemed to follow Player 1's lead, suggesting they might be either a werewolf or a villager. I hope the Witch is still alive and stays hidden. If we have a peaceful night tonight, we have a chance to win. I won't say more; let's hear what Player 8 has to say.

Addressing player 6, there are only two players speaking after you, yet you claim a bad identity? That's too suspicious! From the words of player 6, who's pretending to be the Seer, I learned that there aren't three werewolves present, and they haven't formed a unified voting bloc yet. This means that at least one werewolf between players 3 and 7 has been eliminated, but it's unlikely to be both. If player 6 were the only remaining werewolf, they might not have claimed to be the Seer, because if they're lynched today, the game could end immediately. So we can deduce that one good player and one werewolf have been eliminated from players 3 and 7. The werewolf is most likely number 3, and 7 is probably the Witch, because I don't think the Witch would choose not to save number 2 and instead poison number 7. However, based on the current speeches, there's still one werewolf whose position is unknown. Could it be that player 6 accurately identified me as a bad identity because you, number 9, are their werewolf companion? Of course, this is just my speculation as the Seer in the last speaking position after being identified as a bad identity. If you, number 9, are a good player, I hope you can lend me a hand and help the real Seer lynch player 6. Today, I call on all good players to join forces with me to lynch the werewolf, player 6!",

If his logic holds, it would mean the Witch Number 7 poisoned herself, while the werewolves killed Number 2. Let's not even discuss whether a Witch can go crazy enough to poison herself. According to the game rules, the Witch should try to poison players who are likely to be werewolves to lead the good team to victory. Moreover, Number 8 thinks that Number 6 identified him as a bad identity because Number 9 is Number 6's werewolf partner, which is utterly absurd! If Number 8 claims he randomly checked Number 2, then Number 6 could have randomly checked Number 8 as well. Otherwise, couldn't we also say that it's too fake for Number 8 to give a good identity to Number 2, who's already out as the Hunter? Given that all of Number 8's logic is pseudo-logic forcefully targeting Number 6, I believe Number 6 is the real Seer and Number 8 is a werewolf. I vote for Number 8.",

At this point, if we can vote out the seer, there will only be one witch left. We just need to kill the witch at night to win the game.\n- **Voting for player No. 6**: The disadvantage is that werewolf No. 3 has already been eliminated.
