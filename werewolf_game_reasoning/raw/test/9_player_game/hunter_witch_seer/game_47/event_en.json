The despicable Player 6, a werewolf, pretended to be a Seer before me, which undoubtedly weakened the credibility of my verification. I hope everyone can trust me! My thought process for checking Player 1 was to verify someone near me. If Player 1 turned out to be good, they could help me gather votes. If they were bad, we could directly vote them out. Player 7 died last night, and their identity is unknown. They could have been a villager or hunter killed by werewolves. If Player 7 was the Witch and was attacked, they would likely have saved themselves or used poison to eliminate someone else. However, since we only have one death, Player 7 couldn't have been the Witch. Another possibility is that Player 7 was a werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the Witch's potion, but the Witch didn't save them. This situation is very favorable for us good players. We only need to vote out Player 6, the fake Seer, today, and then find the last werewolf to win the game. Since the Witch still has the healing potion, they should hide well today and conceal their identity to avoid leaving any clues for the cunning werewolves. If the werewolves try to kill me tonight, the Witch should remember to use the healing potion on me so I can report tomorrow's verification. Tonight, I will check Player 4's identity. If Player 4 turns out to be Player 6's werewolf teammate pretending to be another special role, I will check Player 5 instead. I believe Player 8's speech suggests they are a solid good player. As long as Player 8 votes with me, I will never check their identity. Today, I urge all good players to join me in voting out Player 6, the fake Seer werewolf.",

If Player 8 were a werewolf, they would definitely be waiting for their werewolf teammate in a later position to claim the Seer role, rather than suggesting that no one might claim it.

Player 1 is Player 9's good identity, so the remaining werewolves must be among Players 2, 4, and 5.

Since the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, we can determine who the real Hunter is. For now, we can set aside the question of whether Player 9 or Player 6 is the true Seer and make a decision tomorrow after they each provide their verification information.\n\nAt present, Players 2 and 4 are both claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 2: Supports Player 9, believing 9 to be the real Seer. They agree that Player 1 is a confirmed good identity, which aligns with my assessment and seems logical. I believe Player 2 is likely the true Hunter.\n\n- Player 4: Supports Player 6 and claims that Player 2 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter to support Player 9's claim as Seer. However, Player 4 hasn't considered whether Player 2 could be a werewolf trying to get the real Seer (Player 9) lynched. Therefore, I suspect Player 4 is probably a werewolf.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 2 is the real Hunter. I have decided to vote for Player 4.",
