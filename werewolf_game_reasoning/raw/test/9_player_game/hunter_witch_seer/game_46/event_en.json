If Player 4 turns out to be Player 9's werewolf teammate pretending to be another special role, I'll check Player 5's identity instead.

If No. 8 were good and No. 9 were a werewolf, there would be no point for No. 9 to claim No. 8 as a good identity, as it wouldn't bring much benefit. Therefore, I think No. 9 is probably the real Seer. However, No. 1's speech didn't have any major issues, and I haven't heard from the players who haven't spoken yet, so I can't definitively say No. 1 is a werewolf.

If No. 4 is No. 9's werewolf teammate, No. 4 would definitely have made a move, and if No. 1's guess turns out to be correct, it further proves that No. 1 is the real Seer. Currently, the werewolf suspects are No. 9, either No. 4 or No. 6, and the last werewolf can only be No. 3.

I believe player 9 is trying to disguise themselves as a \"seer reporting true verification information\" by deliberately giving a good identity to a player in the front position, using reverse psychology to gain the trust of the good team.\n- **Player 1**: Gave player 2 a good identity. Player 1 analyzed player 9's strategy, spoke with reason and evidence, which aligns with my judgment. I believe player 1 demonstrates the thought process of a seer and is likely the true seer.\nBased on this, I believe player 1 is the true seer, and we'll make our judgments accordingly.\n\n# Identity judgments for other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 9**: Is a werewolf pretending to be a seer against player 1.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- 9 > 4\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 9.",
