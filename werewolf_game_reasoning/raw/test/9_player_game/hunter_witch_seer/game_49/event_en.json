Player 7 died last night, and I can't determine their identity yet. They could be a werewolf who killed themselves, or a villager who was targeted. Player 1 claimed to be the Hunter, and no one has contested this claim, so I tentatively believe they are the real Hunter. Player 2's speech was rather vague, so I can't define their identity at the moment. Today, I ask the good players to join me in voting out any werewolf in the later positions who might pretend to be a Seer. If no werewolf does this, I'll vote for the player with the worst speech. Since the Witch still has the healing potion, I advise them to stay hidden and conceal their identity to avoid leaving any clues for the cunning werewolves. If the werewolves target me tonight, I remind the Witch to use the healing potion on me so I can report another check tomorrow. I will base my next night's check on the speeches and votes, targeting players I suspect to be werewolves.",

So if Player 5 were the real Witch, they wouldn't have poisoned Player 9. The only possibility is that Player 5 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and Player 9 was the real Witch. Yesterday, Player 9 concealed their identity, intending to poison Player 5 at night, but was unfortunately killed by the werewolves. Now, let's look at Player 5's alignment yesterday. Player 5 sided with Player 3, reasoning that Player 4's speech was good. However, today Player 4 was the first to change sides, so I'll temporarily accept Player 4's identity. I believe Player 3, whom Player 5 sided with, is the last werewolf on the field. There are no other wolf positions left.

Therefore, No.9 must be the real witch, and No.5 was a werewolf killed by poison.\n- Yesterday, No.5 sided with No.3. Werewolves have no reason to side with a real seer, so No.3 cannot be the seer.\n- No.3 claimed to have checked No.8 last night, who had sided with him. This behavior is very puzzling. I believe No.3 is pretending to be a seer to divert votes from good players and randomly reported his verification result.\nTherefore, I conclude that No.3 is a werewolf and No.6 is the seer.
