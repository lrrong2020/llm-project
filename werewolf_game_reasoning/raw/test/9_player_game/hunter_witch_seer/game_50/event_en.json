If player 1 is really the witch, then it would be extremely difficult for the good team to win this game. I'm more inclined to think that player 1 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch. The purpose of player 1 pretending to be the witch is to find the real witch, and then kill the real witch at night. So I suggest that if the real witch is in a later position, she should not reveal herself. Instead, she should use her potion to save the player who gets killed at night, or directly poison player 1.

My reasoning for checking Number 8 was that it's a lucky number, as \"8\" represents prosperity. Number 9 died last night, and their identity is currently unknown. Since only Number 9 died last night, the Witch must still have both potions. Number 1 claimed to be the Witch in the early speaking order. If Number 1 were a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, they would surely be poisoned by the real Witch at night, thus exposing a werewolf. So, for now, I believe Number 1 is the real Witch. However, if Number 1 is indeed a werewolf, then the real Witch should be careful to conceal their identity today and not let the cunning werewolves discover any clues. If the werewolves try to kill me, Number 3, tonight, the Witch should use the healing potion to save me so I can report another identity check tomorrow. If the Witch is unfortunately targeted tonight, please poison the player you suspect to be a werewolf, but avoid conflicting with my investigation target. Number 2's speech aligns with a good player's perspective and carefully analyzed the possibility of Number 1 being a werewolf. I believe Number 2 demonstrates the thinking of a good player and is likely a villager. Tonight, I will check Number 4's identity. If Number 4 turns out to be a werewolf teammate trying to protect Number 8 by falsely claiming a special role or pretending to be the Seer, I will then check Number 5's identity.

As a common villager, I'd like to offer sincere praise to our great Seer. Players 3 and 4 are both claiming to be the Seer, but I believe the clever good players can easily discern who the real Seer is. Player 3's logical thinking is clear and orderly, full and sincere. They commented on Player 1, who claimed to be the Witch in an earlier position, and analyzed that Player 9 might be a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive. Player 3 carefully analyzed the situation, which I believe demonstrates the perspective of a true Seer. Player 4, who also claimed to be the Seer, gave a very superficial speech. How can you expect the good team to believe you're the Seer with just a few words, Player 4? I think Player 4 is a werewolf. I believe Player 3 is the real Seer, and this round I will follow Seer 3's lead to vote for Player 8, who was identified as having a bad identity. Players 1 and 5 both claim to be the Witch, and one of them must be a werewolf trying to confuse the good team's perspective. However, I can't distinguish which one is the real Witch at the moment. I suggest that Seer 3 verify either Player 1 or 5 tonight.",
