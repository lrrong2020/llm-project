Player 5 claimed to be the Hunter, seemingly with strong conviction, but their speech was aggressively targeting Player 4. Player 5 absurdly concluded that Player 4 must be a werewolf with vision solely based on Player 4's suggestion that the Witch shouldn't reveal themselves. This logic is utterly unconvincing and laughable. It's common knowledge that concealing special roles benefits the good team; if werewolves identified all the special roles, wouldn't that put the good team in grave danger? Player 5 also predicted that another player would claim to be the Hunter, which I believe is a case of \"the guilty party accusing first.\" The real Hunter would surely challenge Player 5's claim in a fierce confrontation! Given these two suspicious points in Player 5's speech, I believe Player 5 is likely a werewolf forced to pretend to be the Hunter after being identified as bad by the Seer, while Player 4 is probably the real Seer speaking in the first position. As the third speaker and a villager without much information, this is all I can analyze for now. I choose to tentatively support Player 4.",

Although the speaking order is unfavorable for me, Player 4, pretending to be the Seer, claimed to be the Seer before me. However, Player 4 accurately identified Player 5, who works hard harvesting wheat during the day and hunts wild boars with a rifle at night, as the Hunter. Player 7 claimed to be the Hunter and sided with Player 4. It's important to note that the real Hunter can prove their identity by shooting during the day. If Player 7 were the real Hunter, they would have considered that Players 4 and 5 might be \"a Werewolf identifying another Werewolf as bad\" to enhance Player 4's credibility. Therefore, Player 7 is a Werewolf pretending to be the Hunter, and Player 5 is the real Hunter. Following the principle of eliminating the fake Hunter before the real one when there are conflicting Hunter claims, we should all vote to eliminate Player 7 today to gain more information. Player 7 will definitely not be able to shoot, confirming that Player 5 is the real Hunter. This means that Player 4 identifying Player 5 as bad proves that Player 4 is a Werewolf, and the Witch should know how to use their poison.

This is because the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while the Seer cannot. Therefore, we need to prioritize resolving the true Hunter's identity on the first day, allowing the two claimed Seers to report their verification information for one more day before making a decision.\n\nCurrently, players 5 and 7 claim to be the Hunter.\n\n- **Player 5**: After being identified as a werewolf by player 4, they analyzed player 4's mistakes and gave a standard speech.\n\n- **Player 7**: In their speech, player 7 only mentioned the identities of players 4 and 5, without saying anything about player 6 who has already spoken. I believe player 7's perspective is limited, unlike that of a real Hunter. Additionally, only player 1 has claimed to be the Witch, and player 1 also stated that player 7 is a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter.

In the previous round, Player 1 claimed to be the witch and strongly supported the seer in the later position, asserting that there must be another seer. Player 1's perspective was confused and they made mistakes during their speech. Since I, in an earlier position, found Player 5 to be a bad identity with strong evidence, the werewolves had no choice but to launch a strong offensive. Player 1 can only be a werewolf pretending to be the witch, helping their werewolf teammate Player 2 in the offensive. How could such a trick possibly deceive me? Last night, both Player 1 and Player 9 died. If Player 1 were the witch, they definitely wouldn't have poisoned Player 9, so I can only believe that Player 9 was the witch. Because in the previous round, only Player 9 didn't reveal their identity, and the despicable werewolves forced out the witch's identity, resulting in the double death of Players 1 and 9. Now the werewolf positions are very clear: Player 1, a werewolf, was poisoned by Player 9, the witch; Player 5, a werewolf, was shot by Player 7, the hunter. Only Player 2 remains as the lone werewolf struggling to survive. We should vote to eliminate Player 2 this round. I've fully presented my perspective as the seer. The good players present shouldn't question my identity as the seer anymore. Please, good players, act in accordance with your knowledge and vote with me to eliminate Player 2, the werewolf.

Fortunately, the hunter also shot and eliminated the werewolf number 5, helping us regain some ground. Last night, numbers 1 and 9 both died, which likely means that number 1, the witch, was killed by werewolves and then used her poison on number 9, who had a weak performance yesterday. I hope the witch managed to poison a werewolf! As for who's the real seer between numbers 2 and 4, I think if both 4 and 5 were werewolves, it would have been too risky for them to use the \"werewolf identifying werewolf\" strategy in the first position yesterday. Moreover, number 4's speech yesterday sounded quite sincere, and today they're still patiently analyzing the logic for the good team.
