I analyze that since Player 7 is a good role, they are counter-claiming Hunter, so Player 7 is the real Hunter.\n- **Player 8**: Claims to be a Villager, thinks Player 5 is the Hunter, believes Players 6 and 7 are werewolves, thinks Player 4 is a werewolf, wants to vote out No. 7. I analyze that Player 8 has no perspective, so I think Player 8 is a Villager.\n- **Player 9**: Wants to verify the Hunter's gun, wants to choose between voting for No. 5 or No. 7. I analyze that Player 9 is afraid to show too much perspective, so Player 9 might be the Witch.\n- **Player 1**: Claims to be the Witch, says No. 5 is their saved target, thinks Players 4 and 7 are werewolves, wants to vote out No. 7. Player 1 is my werewolf teammate.\n- **Player 2**: Claims to be the Seer, gives Player 4 a bad identity, believes Player 5 is the Hunter, thinks Player 7 is a werewolf, wants to vote out No. 7. I analyze that Player 2 is the real Seer because Player 2's true identity is a good role.\n- **Player 3**: Hasn't identified the Seer, wants to verify the Hunter's gun, wants to vote out No. 7. I analyze that Player 3 is likely a Villager.\n\n# My vote:\n- I choose to vote for Player 7.\n\n# Identity judgments:\n- **Player 1**: Werewolf\n- **Player 2**: Seer\n- **Player 3**: Villager\n- **Player 4**: Werewolf\n- **Player 5**: Werewolf\n- **Player 6**: Villager\n- **Player 7**: Hunter\n- **Player 8**: Villager\n- **Player 9**: Witch",
