Number 6, who spoke before me, claimed to be the Hunter, so I immediately believed them to be the real Hunter. Last night was peaceful, thanks to the Witch using her healing potion to maintain peace in the village, although we can't rule out the possibility of werewolves killing one of their own. Number 5 claimed to be the Witch and said they saved me, Number 7. If Number 5 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in claiming to have saved me, the Seer, and they would risk being poisoned by the real Witch at night, effectively sacrificing a werewolf. So, for now, I believe Number 5 to be the real Witch. Tonight, I will verify Number 2's identity. If Number 2 pretends to be a seer, I will then check Number 3's identity. Today, I ask all good people to join me in voting out the werewolf who will pretend to be a seer in the later speaking positions.

Given that the Hunter can prove their identity by revealing their role card, while the Seer cannot self-verify, we must prioritize eliminating one of the two claimed Hunters this round. This will help us distinguish the real Hunter from the fake one, allowing the two potential Seers (players 7 and 3) to report their verification information for one more day before making a final decision.\n\nAt present, players 6 and 2 are claiming to be the Hunter.\n\n- Player 6: Player 6 is player 7's good identity. Player 5, who spoke first, claimed to be the Witch and gave player 7 a saved identity. Player 7 initially said they believed player 5 was the Witch, but then suggested that last night's saved player might be a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive the Witch. This contradiction in player 7's speech is essentially admitting they are a werewolf who killed themselves. Therefore, I conclude that player 7 is not the real Seer.\n\n- Player 2: Player 2 is player 3's good identity. Since I've determined that player 7 is not the real Seer, player 3 must be the Seer, and player 2 is the good player verified by the real Seer (player 3). Player 2 claims to be the Hunter, and I firmly believe that player 2 is the Hunter. Consequently, player 6 must be a werewolf pretending to be the Hunter in opposition to player 2.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 2 is the real Hunter. I have decided to vote for player 6.",

This can only mean that No. 6 and No. 7 are both werewolves, and I won't believe No. 7 no matter how they try to argue. The werewolf pool consists of No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7. No. 5 is the werewolf competing with No. 8 for the witch role, No. 6 is the werewolf competing with No. 2 for the hunter role, and No. 7 is the werewolf competing with No. 3 for the seer role. No. 2 is the real hunter, and No. 8 is the real witch. This round, I will follow No. 3, the seer, to vote for eliminating No. 7, the werewolf.",
