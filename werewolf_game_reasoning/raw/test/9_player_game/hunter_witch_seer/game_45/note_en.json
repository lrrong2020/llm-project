I believe both Player 1 and 9 are not contributing.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager\n\n**Player 2**:\n- Believes that since Players 1 and 9 claimed to be villagers and they themselves are a villager, they don't dare to attack the earlier positions of Players 1 and 9, but instead pass information to the Seer in later positions. Player 2 might be a werewolf.\nSubjective identity judgment: Villager or lower identity\n\n**Player 3**:\n- I am the Hunter. I think Player 2's behavior of suspecting Players 1 and 9 but not daring to attack them, and instead passing information to the later Seer, is not good.\nSubjective identity judgment: Hunter\n\n**Player 4**:\n- Claims to be a villager, thinks Player 3 attacked Player 2, and with three villager claims before, still doesn't reveal their identity.

Thinks Players 2 and 4 are good. Believes Players 1 and 3 are werewolves, wants to check Player 1, and if Player 8's speech sounds like a werewolf, will check Player 8.\nSubjective identity judgment: Werewolf\n\n**Player 8**:\n- Claims to be the Witch, reports Player 3 as saved. Thinks Player 6 claiming to be the Witch is to support Player 5 as the Seer. Believes the last werewolf is either Player 3 or 4, thinks Player 3 might be the werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the witch's potion.\nSubjective identity judgment: Witch or Werewolf",
