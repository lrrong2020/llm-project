I think both No. 1 and No. 9 are roles without night actions, as they were the first two speakers and provided no information. Player No. 2 also claimed to be a villager, but instead of criticizing the poor speeches of No. 1 and No. 9 who spoke before him, he tried to pass information to the Seer who would speak later.

If I find a good identity, they can assist me in analyzing the situation and identifying hidden werewolves. Among the players who have spoken, player 2 sounds most like a werewolf to me. Player 2 mentioned that players 9, 1, and 2 all claimed to be villagers, so they believe there's likely a werewolf among these three. I ask you all, which good player would knowingly put themselves in a wolf pit? Therefore, I define player 2 as a werewolf who made mistakes during their speech. Player 3's perspective aligns with mine, both considering player 2 a werewolf, so I believe player 3 is likely good. Players 9 and 1 spoke briefly without revealing their perspectives, so I can't define their identities. If the players who haven't spoken yet perform better than 1 and 9, I might check one of them tonight. Player 4's perspective differs from mine, surprisingly defending player 2 who had the most suspicious speech. This means player 4's identity must be lower than player 2's. If no werewolf pretends to be a seer among the remaining players, I suggest we vote for players 2 and 4 this round, as I believe they are both likely werewolves.",

Player No. 5 gave me a good identity when there were only three players left, so I'm highly inclined to believe that No. 5 is the real Seer rather than a werewolf pretending to be one for credibility. Among the five players from No. 9 to No. 4 who claimed to be villagers, there must be at least one werewolf. Tonight, I'll decide my poisoning target based on the voting pattern. Today, I'm voting for the werewolf pretending to be the Seer in the later positions. If the werewolves choose not to pretend, then we'll listen to the Seer's speech and vote for No. 2 and No. 4.",

Player 6, a werewolf, surprisingly pretended to be the Witch before me and claimed to have saved Player 3. I believe Player 6's motive for pretending to be the Witch was to support their werewolf teammate, Player 5, in rallying votes. Player 3 might be a werewolf teammate of Players 5 and 6. I want to correct Seer 7's information: the werewolf pool consists of Players 5 and 6, with the last werewolf possibly being either Player 3 or 4. Player 3 claimed to be on the good side but didn't specify being a villager. Player 6's statement about five players from 9 to 4 claiming to be villagers is completely illogical and lacks a good player's perspective. Player 6, with Players 7 and 8 yet to speak, immediately accepted Player 5 as the real Seer just because Player 5 strongly identified the remaining three players as good. This reasoning is also flawed. Player 5, seeing Player 6 as their werewolf teammate and noticing no one else claimed to be the Seer, deduced that the real Seer must be either Player 7 or 8, so they gave Player 6 a good identity. Player 5 attacked Player 2 in their speech, but I believe Player 2 is an innocent good player. Player 5 labeled Player 2 as a definite werewolf just for including themselves in the werewolf pool, which clearly shows that Player 5 is trying to identify werewolves during the day. Player 5's speech is obviously aimed at finding someone to vote for, and their purpose in voting for Players 2 and 4 is to split the votes. The werewolves will definitely vote for the real Seer. Player 5, as a werewolf, hopes to split the good players' votes so that they and their werewolf teammate can vote out the real Seer. I'm certain that Players 5 and 6 are werewolves, with the last werewolf being either Player 3 or 4. Today, good players should follow me in voting out Player 5, the pretend Seer werewolf. Tonight, I'll use my poison on Player 6, the werewolf. Seer 7 can check Player 4's identity tonight to find the last werewolf. If Player 7 is killed tomorrow morning, we good players will need to reasonably distinguish the last werewolf between Players 3 and 4 based on their speeches and voting patterns.",

Given that I can see my role card as the Witch, No.5's credibility is undoubtedly huge, as he's not afraid of me turning against him and claiming to be the Seer. Therefore, I believe No.5 is most likely the real Seer.\n- **Player No.7**: The biggest problem with No.7 is that he didn't mention Player No.6 at all. No.6, being the good identity given by No.5 who is competing with No.7 for the Seer role, is very likely to be No.5's werewolf teammate. No.7's complete silence on No.6's identity is not consistent with a Seer's perspective in my opinion. It seems more like No.7 already knew No.6 was a good person. Moreover, since No.6 claimed to be the Witch, No.7 dares not attack No.6. Additionally, No.8 is competing with No.6 (me) for the Witch role, and No.8, likely a werewolf, chose to side with No.7 and vote for No.5. This further strengthens my belief that No.5 is the real Seer.\n\n# In conclusion, I believe No.5 is the Seer and No.7 is pretending to be the Seer. This round, I will vote for Player No.7.",

Player 6 is the witch but sided with player 5, who is a werewolf. Player 8 is a werewolf pretending to be the witch, and yesterday they managed to get player 7, the real seer, voted out. Regardless of whether the good players in later positions believe player 6 or 8 to be the witch, they both attacked me, player 4, so my identity must be good. The werewolves should be players 1, 5, and 8. Because players 1, 2, 9, and I (player 4) all claimed to be villagers, one of those three must be a werewolf. We know player 9 was verified as good by player 7, and player 2 was analyzing player 5's identity with me yesterday, so player 1 must be the werewolf. We shouldn't listen to player 1, the werewolf in the last position, when they call for votes. The good team should join hands and all vote to eliminate player 5. I'm casting my vote to eliminate player 5.",
