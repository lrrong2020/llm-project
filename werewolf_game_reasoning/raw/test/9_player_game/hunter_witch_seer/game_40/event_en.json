I hope I've eliminated a werewolf, and if No. 9, the Gunner, shot another werewolf, then there would be only one werewolf left in the game! Of course, this is just my personal speculation! The reason I decided to claim the Witch role is that I feel at least one werewolf between No. 1 and No. 4 has been eliminated. If I don't claim to be the Witch, there's a chance that a werewolf in a later position might pretend to be the Witch and vote me out, or secretly kill me at night, which would interfere with the good team's perspective and affect their judgment. So I must claim to be the Witch this round. I trust my judgment and ability to choose sides. After hearing the counter-claims from the players in later positions, I will make my decision on whom to support! Therefore, I sincerely request the Seer in a later position to speak well, demonstrate your perspective as a Seer, exile the despicable werewolf, and lead us good people to victory!",

I thought this might be a sign from above, guiding me to uncover a werewolf. So, I decided to check player 1, and sure enough, I found a big bad wolf!

Players 2 and 3, who spoke before me, didn't provide much logical output, but they were seriously analyzing the situation. Therefore, I believe players 2 and 3 are good. I ask players 2 and 3 to vote with me! Player 5 claims to be the Witch, so I'll trust their identity for now. We only need to see if player 5 dies tonight or if it's a peaceful night to determine if player 5 is the real Witch.

They courageously revealed their identity, risking being killed by werewolves, to help the good team turn the tide and find werewolves. This is exactly the legendary Seer I have in mind. No. 6, as a werewolf, isn't even trying to deceive us with normal speech anymore. They even made up an excuse about \"Children's Day\". Do they really think we're that stupid? I believe No. 5 is the Witch. If No. 5 were a werewolf, there would be no benefit in pretending to be the Witch. No. 2 and No. 3 both gave vague speeches, so their identities are unclear. I suggest that Seer No. 7 checks No. 3 tonight. This round, I will vote to eliminate No. 6.",
