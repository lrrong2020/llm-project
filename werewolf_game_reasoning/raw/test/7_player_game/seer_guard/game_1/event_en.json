My comments on the players who have already spoken in the front positions are as follows: Players 6 and 7's speeches didn't provide much information and showed little effort, so I can't determine if they are good or werewolves yet. If the players in later positions, 3 and 5, both support me, I might choose to check either Player 6 or 7. Otherwise, I'll likely suspect that there's a werewolf among Players 3 and 5, which would explain why Player 1 chose to give me a bad identity at this position. Of course, without hearing their speeches, everything is still unknown. Players 3 and 5, don't let this point discourage you from supporting me. If you are good people, I hope you can find me.

Of course, I won't vote them out on the first day, and it's not their turn today either. Let's wait and hear what they say tomorrow.\n\nNo. 1 stood up and declared No. 2 as a bad identity. No. 1's credibility is certainly higher than No. 2's, but I feel No. 1 didn't say enough. If you're the Seer, you should talk more, especially since there isn't much logic to analyze right now. In comparison, No. 2's speech was noticeably better than No. 1's. You could say No. 2 is pretending to be a seer, but it's not uncommon for werewolves to challenge the real Seer either. So today, I'm leaning towards supporting No. 2.\n\nAs for No. 4 who was eliminated last night, they were undoubtedly a good person. One of No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 is likely No. 1's werewolf teammate.

Moreover, Player 1 has already identified Player 2 as a bad identity, so how could they say, \"Unless Player 2 pretends to be a seer immediately, who among the later positions would pretend to be a seer?\" In a setup with a seer and a guard, if Player 2 were truly Player 1's bad identity, would Player 1 say such a thing? Therefore, I deduce that Player 1 might have said that because they couldn't determine which card in the later positions is the seer. I find Player 2's comments on the earlier positions acceptable; at least it shows the behavior of a seer working for the good team. I am a good card, and based on Player 1's speech, I believe Player 3 is also a good card, as their viewpoint is very similar to mine. Player 7's speech was very perfunctory. As a good card, at least when Player 4 was eliminated, you should have commented on the positions next to you, rather than just glossing over it.

Player 5 using this logic against me to argue that I can't be the real seer is invalid.\n\nPlayer 2 immediately claimed to be the seer, likely because Player 5, whom I intend to verify, is their werewolf teammate in a later position.

Since we're communicating through text, we can't analyze tone, speech patterns, emotions, or attitudes. It's almost impossible for werewolves to make mistakes in their speech, and even if they type something like \"I'm a seer,\" they can easily check and correct errors. So, as a neutral player, I have no perspective. I want to address Player 2. I voted for you yesterday because your PK speech suddenly revealed you as a werewolf when you said things like \"Good players should step forward\" and \"I don't need to verify at night, those who vote incorrectly will be eliminated tomorrow.\" My goodness, how could anyone believe that? It was so extreme it almost seemed fake. But compared to Player 1's convincing bad identity claim, I can't support you, Player 2, anymore. The situation is clear now. From the voting patterns of the past two rounds, we can see that Players 2 and 5 are on the same side. I don't believe whatever role Player 5 claims to be.
