I thought if I could speak before Player 2, whether I found them to be good or a werewolf, my statement would carry more weight and be more convincing. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. Player 1, pretending to be a Seer, spoke first from the starting position and tried to gain the trust of good players by declaring later players as good, coincidentally including Player 2, whom I had verified as good. I'm truly at a loss for words and on the verge of tears.\n\nPlayer 2 has now received confirmation of their good identity from both Player 1, who is pretending to be the Seer, and myself, the real Seer. This makes Player 2 the most credible player in the game, qualified to lead the good team as an undoubtedly good player. I hope Player 2 will acknowledge my identity as the Seer. I've been disadvantaged by the speaking order, which is beyond my control. I admit that the credibility of my verification might seem less than Player 1's, but distinguishing between the real and fake Seer isn't a simple matter of just comparing credibility.\n\nPlayer 1 claimed to be delighted with this speaking order, but if I were the Seer speaking first, I wouldn't be so happy. I wouldn't be able to hear any other player's speech or help analyze the situation for the good team. Player 1's attitude doesn't seem fitting for a real Seer.\n\nRegarding Player 7, their identity can indeed only be either a villager or a guard, which is solid logic and doesn't require further analysis.\n\nToday, I hope the good players can identify me as the real Seer and work with me to vote out Player 1, who is pretending to be the Seer. Tonight, I will verify the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on the speeches and voting patterns of the players who speak after me. If the guard is still in the game, please don't reveal yourself yet, but do protect me tonight.",

Furthermore, player 3 giving me a good identity further confirms that if player 1 is a werewolf, then player 1 giving a good identity to a later speaker is just gambling for credibility. In terms of verification strength, player 1's is clearly stronger because if player 1 were a werewolf, giving a good identity to a later speaker could potentially identify the real seer, leading to their own downfall during the sheriff election, which would cause the werewolf team to collapse.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe player 1 is the true seer, and I decide to vote for player 3.",
