It's impossible for No. 6 and No. 7 to be two werewolves who meet at night. If the good team votes out No. 7, and the real witch poisons No. 6 who pretends to be the witch at night, wouldn't the werewolf team collapse immediately?

I suspect player 1 might be a werewolf teammate supporting player 7.\n- **Player 5**: Also praised player 7's speech extensively, without analyzing the competing seers' statements.

If Player 6 is the real Witch, then Player 7 must be a werewolf. In this case, Player 7's werewolf teammate in the later speaking positions would certainly pretend to be the Witch to help Player 7's aggressive play. However, this didn't happen in this round. Therefore, we can only assume that Player 6 is a werewolf pretending to be the Witch, and the real Witch believes that the good team can identify the correct side and chooses to remain hidden to avoid exposure.\n\n- **Player 3**: Player 3's speech was standard, but their reasoning that Players 6 and 7 are both werewolves doesn't seem like the thought process of a good player. Player 6 spoke first and pretended to be the Witch, while Player 7 reported their werewolf teammate as a bad identity. This strategy would yield almost no benefit for the werewolf team. Therefore, there are significant issues with Player 3's speech.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe Player 7 is the real Seer, and Player 6 is the werewolf who was reported as a bad identity.\n\n# Based on the above analysis, I think voting for Player 6 is the better choice in this round.",

Because if Player 7 were a werewolf giving a bad identity to the witch, then surely one of Player 7's werewolf teammates in the later speaking positions would have pretended to be the witch to support Player 7's claim. But this didn't happen. So, I'd rather believe that the real witch chose not to claim their role because they thought Player 6's speech couldn't fool the good team, instead of believing that no werewolf supported Player 7's claim.
