Fortunately, the good identity he claimed aligns with my verification - indeed a good person, ruling out the possibility of a wolf-wolf-good scenario. Unfortunately, No. 6 spoke before me, so I'm in a later speaking position than No. 6. The credibility of my verification of No. 6 as a good identity is indeed not as strong as No. 4's. It's understandable if No. 6 doesn't believe I'm the Seer, but this is the fact. I can't possibly fabricate another verification result on the spot. Although No. 6 can't help me gather votes, it doesn't matter. It's already obvious who we should vote for today! I hope No. 4's werewolf teammate can come forward to take the fall for me. This way, we won't need to analyze who No. 4's other werewolf partner is! Because after hearing No. 3 and No. 5's speeches, I don't think there's enough evidence to prove they are No. 4's wolf companions. So currently, I'm more focused on No. 1 and No. 2's speeches. I believe the other wolf is either No. 1 or No. 2. Given that those who call for votes in later positions are likely to be wolves, it's possible that I might be voted out today. In that case, I suggest the Witch reconsider and use the poison on No. 4 tonight. Otherwise, the good team will fall seriously behind in turns.",
