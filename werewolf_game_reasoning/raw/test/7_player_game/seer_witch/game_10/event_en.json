Player 4 died last night, their identity is unknown, and the Witch still has the healing potion. I am very dissatisfied with this speaking order. My bad identity is actually pretending to be a Seer before me and declaring me as a werewolf, which makes me extremely angry and furious. I hope the good people can recognize me as the real Seer. If I were a werewolf, I wouldn't pretend to be a Seer right after being checked and then declare the real Seer as a werewolf. Therefore, I can only be the real Seer who checks players at night. Player 5's earlier speech was rather vague, but at least they didn't try to frame me, so I believe player 5 is good. Today, I ask all good people to join me in voting out player 6, the werewolf. I suggest the Witch hide their identity and use the healing potion at night to ensure a peaceful night and prevent the werewolves from targeting the special roles. As the Seer, my responsibility is to use my checking ability to lead the good people to victory. After nightfall, I will check those I suspect to be werewolves.",

And this part of the speech: \"If I were a werewolf, I wouldn't pretend to be a seer right here and then declare a bad identity for the real seer. Therefore, I can only be the real seer who verifies players at night.\" This logic is as fake as it can be. Werewolves have the most flexibility in their actions; they can declare good or bad identities as they wish. Where's the logic in saying that giving your opponent a bad identity makes you the real seer? Moreover, player 7 baselessly claims that player 5 is good, simply because they didn't target you. My goodness! Every sentence from player 7 can be described as wildly imaginative. I can't accept that player 7 is the seer. Don't even talk about leading the good team to victory; you're more likely leading your werewolf team to defeat. When player 7 says player 5 is good before being voted out, I believe this is true because it's kind. So player 5 is the villager card they're revealing.

Player 7 pretended to be a seer immediately after being declared as a bad identity by player 6, and in turn declared player 6 as a bad identity. I cannot agree with player 7's reasoning for checking identities.
