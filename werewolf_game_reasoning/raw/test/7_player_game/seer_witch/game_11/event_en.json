I was worried that Player 3 might be a self-stabbing werewolf, so I chose not to save them.

As the saying goes, \"With both potions in hand, I rule the world\". The werewolves must target me tonight, otherwise tomorrow will surely be a peaceful night!

From their perspective, I would likely claim to be the Seer, yet they made no defensive moves against me.

Moreover, the sole seer (player 2) also believes player 1 is a werewolf and calls for a vote against them. As a good player, I should follow the seer's lead to vote out the suspected werewolf and avoid split voting.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for player 1.",

In this case, only player 4 (the witch) remains as a special role, and the good team would lose regardless. Therefore, logically and intuitively, we can only trust that player 2 is the seer, and player 3 was a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive the witch.\n- Thus, we only need to find the last werewolf among players 1, 5, and 7 this round.\n\n# Werewolf probability analysis:\n- **Player 1**: Gave a vague speech, highest probability of being a werewolf.\n- **Player 5**: Also gave a vague speech, but compared to player 1, still expressed some logic. Medium probability of being a werewolf.\n- **Player 7**: Gave a lengthy speech with thorough reasoning, most likely a good player.\n- With only one werewolf left in the game, I believe player 1 is the last werewolf.\n\n# In conclusion, I think voting for player 1 is the better choice this round.",
