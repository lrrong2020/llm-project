Since only Players 2 and 3 are in later speaking positions after Player 1's pretend Seer claim, Player 1 certainly wouldn't dare to declare them as good identities. Player 1's statement that \"Player 7 being killed at night probably means a good player was eliminated\" is sufficient to prove that Player 1 is a werewolf who opens their eyes at night. Player 1 could see that Player 7 was a good player, and based on Player 1's speech, I deduce that Player 7 was likely the good player who was killed. I'm inclined to believe that Player 5, who claimed to be the Witch in an earlier speaking position, is indeed the real Witch, because there's no benefit for a werewolf to falsely claim the Witch role when no one has claimed to be the Seer yet. Tonight, I will verify the identity of either Player 4 or Player 6. Today, I ask all good players to vote with me against Player 1, who is a werewolf.

Player 1 would have a 50% chance of successfully challenging the true seer, which is an enormous temptation for a werewolf. They would definitely take the risk and declare either Player 2 or 3 as a bad identity! Player 1's claimed reasoning for checking Player 2 was \"I felt an eerie wind coming from Player 2, so I decided to verify them.\" I believe this logic could only fool children; who would believe such nonsensical lies? Player 1 directly assumed that Player 7, who was eliminated last night, was good, without considering the possibility of Player 7 being a self-killing werewolf. I think Player 1's perspective is flawed and unlike what a seer should have. In contrast, Player 2's speech was well-reasoned and eloquent, carefully analyzing the situation and even deducing why Player 1 didn't dare to give Players 2 and 3 a good identity. I find Player 2's analysis spot-on, completely in line with my thoughts. Player 2's demeanor is upright and composed, which is exactly how a seer should be! Player 2's appearance is like a purple aura from the east, emanating a sacred purple light, truly embodying a knowledgeable and discerning world-class seer.

The speaking order is Player 1, then Player 2.\n- **Player 1**: Declares Player 2 as a bad identity. Player 1's speech is very hollow, apart from calling for votes against Player 2, they didn't make any evaluations on the speeches or identities of other surviving players, which doesn't align with the mindset of a seer who should be concerned about the welfare of the village.\n- **Player 2**: Verified Player 3 as a good identity, evaluated Player 5's identity, and has plans for tonight's verification. Compared to Player 1, Player 2 seems more like a responsible seer.\nBased on this, I believe Player 2 is the true seer, and we'll make judgments accordingly.\n\n# Identity judgments of other players based on the seer's information:\n- **Player 1**: A werewolf pretending to be a seer against Player 2.\n- **Player 3**: Player 2's confirmed good identity.\n\n# Ranking of werewolf possibilities:\n- Player 1 > Player 2 > Player 3\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player 1.",

Furthermore, player 1 judges that player 7, who was eliminated during the night, is a good person, without considering the possibility that player 7 could be a werewolf who killed themselves to deceive the witch. I believe player 1 lacks the proper perspective, doesn't possess the seer's viewpoint, and is most likely pretending to be a seer.\n\n- **Player 2**: Player 2 immediately claimed to be the seer after being accused by player 1. Although this might seem less convincing than player 1, we should consider that from player 1's perspective, only players 2 and 3 were left to speak after them. In player 1's view, one of these two must be the seer, giving them a 50% chance of correctly identifying the seer. This is enough for player 1 to risk declaring a bad identity to gain credibility. Moreover, player 2's speech carefully analyzes the current situation, demonstrating a seer's perspective.
