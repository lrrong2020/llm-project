Stand with me and the seer in the later positions; there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Also, Player 5, you said you'll check Player 7 tonight, but what if Player 7 claims to be the seer against you? Player 6 received a good identity but didn't state their stance or evaluate Player 5, just spouting nonsense. Today we must vote out Player 5 unanimously, and Player 6 should be poisoned. Your speech after receiving a good identity was poor, so Player 5, you should be eliminated too.

Firstly, player 5 in the early speaking order claimed to be the Seer and reported that player 6 was checked with some credibility. However, player 6's speech was incomprehensible. As player 7 mentioned, player 6's speech seemed prepared in advance. If player 5 were a werewolf, player 6 certainly wouldn't be. Player 5's credibility as a Seer comes from being the first to speak and giving a good identity to a player in a later speaking position, rather than reporting a bad identity. This supports player 5's claim as the Seer. The weak point in player 5's speech was the statement \"If I'm a werewolf, you can only suspect that players 5 and 6 are both werewolves.\" I didn't understand the logic behind this statement. Player 7's speech lacked any aggression and seemed more like \"a werewolf afraid to comment.\" I've marked player 1 as a good person. I agree with their criticism of player 6's nonsensical speech. The idea that players 5 and 6 are both werewolves is definitely incorrect. It could only be that player 5 is pretending to be the Seer and brainwashing player 6, but they can't both be werewolves. If player 5 were a werewolf, what benefit would there be in being the first to speak and giving a good identity to player 6, their werewolf teammate? Even if they could survive, the werewolf position would still be found. Werewolves always act for a benefit, and I believe there's no benefit in a werewolf doing this. Therefore, I believe player 5 is the real Seer, and I choose to support player 5.",

This carries significant weight, as they're not afraid of being challenged during the police chief election. It's even stronger than declaring bad identities for later positions. If Number 5 were a werewolf, I don't think they would risk declaring good identities. So, I find Number 5's logic sound when they say that if they're a werewolf, then Numbers 5 and 6 must both be werewolves.\n\nNumber 6's speech seems pre-prepared and delivered without modification. In my view, since you're declared as a good identity by Number 5, you can be more relaxed. At most, it's a perfunctory speech. Therefore, Number 1's attack on Number 6 seems forced. They claim to be a civilian card and want to vote out both Numbers 5 and 6? I ask Number 1, what role are you to make such statements? Your points against Numbers 5 and 6 aren't based on sound logic.\n\nLet's see if Number 4 in the last position claims to be the Seer. If Number 4 doesn't claim, I'm likely to vote for Number 1 today. If Number 4 does claim, I'll vote between Numbers 4 and 5. Number 2's speech is also quite confusing, supporting Number 1 yet siding with Number 5. What kind of logic is this?",

Player 5 identified player 6 as a good identity, and I myself am also a good card. Therefore, I must question player 7's identity. I believe player 7 is a werewolf who performed a self-kill. Just look at their speech carefully. No wonder it's a timid werewolf game with no one jumping out. They're hoping for the witch to come and save player 7. From the seating arrangement, player 3 is the witch, player 5 is the seer, player 6 is a good identity, I'm a good card, and player 7 is player 3's saved target. Does this mean players 1 and 2 are both werewolves? Player 2 defended player 1, and player 1 seemed to be hinting at player 7, suggesting not to push out player 6 who is a good card. The probability of player 7 being a werewolf is quite high. In this round, player 7's speech showed some hostility towards player 5. As a good person, player 7 should be hostile towards me instead of player 5, so player 7 can only be a werewolf. Another point is that player 7 recognized player 6 as a good person, even though player 5 had already said that player 6 could claim any role. If you didn't think of this, then you, player 7, can only be a werewolf. Don't say I'm attacking you too harshly; the logic is here. Moreover, I've heard the speeches from the previous players, and there are only three cards left for the werewolf positions, so you can only be a werewolf card. Commenting on player 1, I think player 6's speech did have the flaw you mentioned, but does it warrant such a strong desire to kill? You immediately suggested eliminating player 5 and poisoning player 6. I now suspect that players 1 and 7 might be a werewolf pair. Player 7 shows hostility towards player 5, while you, player 1, harbor killing intentions towards player 6. Could you be any more obvious? Commenting on player 2, you tell me you're a good person, but I don't quite understand where your goodness lies. If you're siding with player 5, shouldn't you trust that player 6 is a good card? How did you manage to defend player 1? You can also see that player 2 wants player 6 to be eliminated, yet you still defend player 1? In my eyes, among players 1, 2, and 7, two of you are werewolves. Personally, I think we should vote out player 1. Player 1's actions are typical werewolf behavior. Tomorrow, the witch should poison player 7, who is likely a self-killed werewolf. If the game doesn't end then, we should vote out player 2, and then the game should conclude.",

Moreover, player 1's hostility towards players 5 and 6 is too strong, which provides a very suitable reason for voting them out.\n- **Voting for player 2**: As my fellow werewolf, I choose to criticize them slightly in my speech while secretly protecting them. I shouldn't protect player 1.\n- **Voting for player 7**: The reason for not calling for votes on player 7 is to avoid the witch questioning my identity and potentially poisoning me at night. First, player 7 was saved by player 3 (the witch), so the witch will still trust them. Therefore, in my speech, I can only portray player 7 as a werewolf who killed themselves to defraud the witch's potion, in order to gain the witch's trust.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe voting for player 1 is the better choice.",

Instead, they say \"we can only compare with the Seer who claims the role in the later position,\" which is a strange perspective, assuming there must be a werewolf claiming to be the Seer in the later position. Secondly, while Number 7 doesn't think Numbers 5 and 6 are both werewolves, they directly judge Number 6 as biased without any reason, which is suspicious of having inside information, assuming Number 6 is a real good identity.\n- In Number 1's speech, the statement \"You, Number 5 Seer, verified the wrong person\" shows that Number 1 acknowledges the possibility of Number 5 being the Seer. However, they then say \"let's support the Seer in the later position\" and \"we must unanimously vote out Number 5 today, and Number 6 should be poisoned.\" Number 1's speech is self-contradictory, as if they know Number 5 is the Seer but are determined to lead the charge for the werewolf team.\n- Moreover, Number 1 strongly suspects Number 6 as a definite werewolf, yet prioritizes voting out Number 5. Number 1 asks Number 5, \"What if Number 7 claims to be the Seer against you?\" In Number 1's logic, while they believe Numbers 5 and 6 are both werewolves and are determined to support the later Seer, they turn around to analyze the relationship between Numbers 5 and 6. This contradiction clearly reveals their werewolf identity.\n- I reasonably suspect that the werewolf team planned to kill one of their own during the night to defraud the Witch's potion, and take action during the day. However, as Number 5, I directly gave a good identity to a later position player, which was too strong and caused the werewolf team's plan to fall apart. This led to the current situation of having only one claimed Seer.\n- Based on the single Seer scenario, I suspect Numbers 1 and 7 to be werewolves.\n- However, Number 7 is Number 3 Witch's first night save, so Number 1's turn comes before Number 7.\n\nIn conclusion, I decide to vote for Player Number 1.",

The answer must be that Number 2 is the werewolf! Because if Number 1 were a werewolf, there would definitely be a werewolf teammate in the later positions preparing to pretend to be a seer. Number 1's speech attacked Numbers 5 and 6, which would be setting the stage for their werewolf teammate in a later position to claim to be the seer. However, Numbers 2 and 4 didn't claim to be the seer, which indirectly betrayed Number 1. Therefore, if Number 1 were a werewolf, there are no werewolf teammates in later positions. So, is it possible that Number 7 in an earlier position could be Number 1's werewolf teammate? The answer is also no. Because Number 7 didn't claim to be the seer, if Number 1 was the last werewolf to speak and had already chosen not to claim to be the seer, there's no reason to attack Numbers 5 and 6. So if Number 1 were a werewolf, they would have no teammates at all, therefore Number 1 must be a good player. On the contrary, Number 2's speech has a fatal logical gap. Number 2 pointed out the flaws in Number 5's speech but didn't explain why they directly sided with Number 5. Number 2 is trying to create a double-seer situation for the sake of it. I guess the werewolves' night strategy was to play it safe, and Number 2 already knew during the chat that this would be a single-seer game, so they deliberately didn't reveal their perspective and forcibly tried to create a double-seer situation. I believe everyone should understand why Number 1 is a good player, so please vote for Number 4.",

Their attempt to analyze Player 1's speech seems to be setting up for a werewolf in a later position to claim the Seer role. As a werewolf, Player 7 shouldn't be able to deduce this setup for a later player. Moreover, in the first round, Player 7 targeted Player 5.
