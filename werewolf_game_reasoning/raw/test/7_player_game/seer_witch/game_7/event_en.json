Even for Player 4, you need to carefully analyze their speech to determine if there's a possibility of a werewolf killing their teammate. Perhaps a Seer in an early position hopes the Witch will gather votes. We should observe other players' speeches, particularly focusing on their statements and voting patterns. Those whose words and actions are inconsistent are likely to be werewolves.",
