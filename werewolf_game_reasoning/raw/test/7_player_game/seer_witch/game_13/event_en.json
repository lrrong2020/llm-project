To the real seer in later positions, if I were a werewolf, I would never take the risk of playing the \"werewolf accusing werewolf\" strategy when there are only two werewolves left. So I must be a wrongly accused good person. I hope you can recognize this. Tonight, you can verify the identity of either Player 5 or 6, and I believe you might find something!

If you can consider such ambiguous speeches from Players 5 and 6 as \"acceptable,\" then I suppose no speech would be unacceptable in your eyes!

Player 1, as my reverse good identity, I believe their speech doesn't align with Player 7, so Player 1 is likely a good person. Player 2, who spoke earlier, is probably a good person because they analyzed Player 7's mistakes. Player 7, I can somewhat accept that you think Player 5 seems like a good person based on their opening speech about mindset, but how can you define Player 6 as a good person with such a vague speech?

Player 1's speech can be described as extremely far-fetched. Firstly, they believe that the earlier positions, Players 5 and 6, were both giving vague speeches without any revealing points, and they're forcefully trying to pin one of them as a werewolf. Secondly, Player 1 also claimed that they didn't play the \"werewolf identifying werewolf\" trick with their werewolf teammates, which confuses me greatly. Player 1, you were identified as a bad identity by Player 7, how can you use the fact that you didn't employ the \"werewolf identifying werewolf\" strategy as proof that you're a good person? To be honest, I think Player 1 is a werewolf deliberately making mistakes during their speech, trying to convince the good team that Player 7 is the Seer. Player 1's goal is to sacrifice themselves, making me, the Witch, poison the real Seer, and then have me killed during the night! I won't let Player 1's scheme succeed.

Secondly, player 1 also claimed not to have played the \"werewolf checking werewolf\" trick with their werewolf teammates, which confused me greatly. Player 1 was given a bad identity by player 7, so it's unlikely they would use the \"not playing werewolf checking werewolf\" strategy to prove they're good.

Player 1 is trying to sacrifice themselves, hoping the witch will poison the seer, then kill me during the night, thus winning the game.
